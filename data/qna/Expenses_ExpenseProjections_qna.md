Question: How many ways are there to enter future Expenses?
Answer: There are four ways to enter future Expenses:
1. Percent of Sales for Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) and General Expenses: This method allows you to enter a percentage of sales for COGS and general expenses for each of years 1-3, as well as a percentage for all years after Year 3. This can be done on the Step 3 Sales and EBITDA Input page while entering Base Sales and/or Base EBITDA Inputs.
2. Percent of Sales for COGS and General Expenses for Horizon Years: On the Cash Flow Control page in Step 3, you can enter a percentage of sales for COGS and general expenses for the Horizon Years. These entries will override any conflicting entries made on the Sales and EBITDA page and can be used to adjust the Sales and Expense projections.
3. Individual Scheduled Item pages: For more detailed Sales and Expense inputs, you can use the Individual Scheduled Item pages. This method is useful when specific detailed expense projections are necessary by month during the year. You can input individual Sales and Expense projections in detail, including units and $/unit inputs for inventory use, expensed COGS type expenses, and capitalized COGS type expenses.
4. Operating Expense Adjustment page: This method is specifically for entering individual overhead and general expenses that are not considered Cost of Goods Sold type of expenses. You can enter these expenses using the Operating Expense Adjustment page.
