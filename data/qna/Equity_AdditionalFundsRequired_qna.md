Question: What is the purpose of the "Additional Funds Required" amount shown on the Transaction Sheet Deal Structure?
Answer: The purpose of the "Additional Funds Required" amount shown on the Transaction Sheet Deal Structure is to indicate the amount of capital that is needed beyond what is provided by the Transaction Deal Structure. This amount represents the shortfall in capital that is required to meet the financial needs of the transaction. It serves as a clear indicator of the additional funds that are necessary to complete the deal successfully. The "Additional Funds Required" amount is shown separately on the Balance Sheet's Equity Section as assumed equity provided when the equity holders in the deal own 100% of the equity of the post-closing company. However, if the equity holders are only purchasing a portion of the company, the additional funds required will not flow to the Equity Section of the Balance Sheet. In this case, the "Additional Funds Required" serves as informational data rather than a direct financial component of the post-closing balance sheet.

Question: Where will the additional funds required flow to if the Equity holders in the Deal own 100% of the equity of the post closing company?
Answer: If the Equity holders in the Deal own 100% of the equity of the post closing company, the additional funds required will flow to the Equity Section of the Balance Sheet as assumed equity provided. It will be shown in a separate line of the Equity Section of the Balance Sheet as "Additional Funds Required".

Question: How will the additional funds required be shown in the Equity Section of the Balance Sheet?
Answer: If the Equity holders in the Deal own 100% of the equity of the post-closing company, the additional funds required will be shown in a separate line of the Equity Section of the Balance Sheet as "Additional Funds Required". This means that the amount will be included as assumed equity provided by the Equity holders.
However, if the Equity holders in the Deal are not purchasing 100% of the equity of the post-closing company, the additional funds required will not be included in the Equity Section of the Balance Sheet. This is because the post-closing Balance Sheet represents 100% of the Company, and the purchase is only a portion of the Company. In this case, the Deal Transaction between the old equity holders and the new equity holders will occur outside the Company's post-closing balance sheet. Therefore, the "Additional Funds Required" amount is only for information purposes and will not be reflected in the Equity Section of the Balance Sheet.

Question: What happens to the additional funds required if the Equity holders in the Deal are not purchasing 100% of the equity of the post closing company?
Answer: If the Equity holders in the Deal are not purchasing 100% of the equity of the post closing company, the additional funds required will not flow to the Equity Section of the Balance Sheet. This is because the post closing Balance Sheet represents 100% of the Company. In this case, the Deal Transaction is between the old equity holders and the new equity holders and will occur outside the Company's post closing balance sheet. Therefore, the "Additional Funds Required" is only for information purposes and will not be reflected in the Equity Section of the Balance Sheet.

Question: Why does the additional funds required not flow to the Equity Section of the Balance Sheet in this case?
Answer: The additional funds required do not flow to the Equity Section of the Balance Sheet when the equity holders in the deal are not purchasing 100% of the equity of the post-closing company. This is because the post-closing Balance Sheet represents 100% of the company, and the purchase in this case is only a portion of the company. 
In such a scenario, the deal transaction occurs between the old equity holders and the new equity holders outside of the company's post-closing balance sheet. Therefore, the "Additional Funds Required" amount is not considered as assumed equity provided and does not appear as a separate line in the Equity Section of the Balance Sheet. 
Instead, the "Additional Funds Required" is mentioned for informational purposes only, indicating that there is a shortfall in the required capital that is not being covered by the transaction deal structure.

Question: What does the post closing Balance Sheet represent in this scenario?
Answer: In this scenario, the post closing Balance Sheet represents 100% of the Company. It includes the assets, liabilities, and equity of the company after the completion of the transaction. If the Equity holders in the Deal own 100% of the equity of the post closing company, any additional funds required will flow to the Equity Section of the Balance Sheet as assumed equity provided and will be shown in a separate line as "Additional Funds Required". However, if the Equity holders in the Deal are not purchasing 100% of the equity of the post closing company, the additional funds required will not be reflected in the Equity Section of the Balance Sheet. In this case, the Deal Transaction between the old equity holders and the new equity holders will occur outside the Company's post closing balance sheet, and the "Additional Funds Required" amount is provided for informational purposes only.

Question: Who is involved in the Deal Transaction if the Equity holders are not purchasing 100% of the equity of the post closing company?
Answer: If the Equity holders are not purchasing 100% of the equity of the post-closing company, the Deal Transaction will occur between the old equity holders and the new equity holders. In this scenario, the old equity holders and the new equity holders are the parties involved in the Deal Transaction. The additional funds required in this case will not flow to the Equity Section of the Balance Sheet, as the post-closing Balance Sheet represents 100% of the company. The "Additional Funds Required" amount is provided for information purposes only.

Question: Where does the Deal Transaction occur in this case?
Answer: In the case where the equity holders in the deal are not purchasing 100% of the equity of the post-closing company, the deal transaction will occur outside the company's post-closing balance sheet. This means that the transaction will take place between the old equity holders and the new equity holders, separate from the company's financial statements. The "Additional Funds Required" amount, in this case, is only provided for information purposes and will not flow to the equity section of the balance sheet.

Question: What is the purpose of the "Additional Funds Required" if the Equity holders are not purchasing 100% of the equity of the post closing company?
Answer: If the Equity holders are not purchasing 100% of the equity of the post closing company, the "Additional Funds Required" amount serves as an informational figure. It does not flow to the Equity Section of the Balance Sheet because the post closing Balance Sheet represents 100% of the company. In this scenario, the Deal Transaction occurs between the old equity holders and the new equity holders outside of the company's post closing balance sheet. Therefore, the "Additional Funds Required" is provided for informational purposes only and does not impact the balance sheet.
