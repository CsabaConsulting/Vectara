Question: Should an Exit Value be entered for only the end of the Horizon time period?
Answer: No, an Exit Value should not be entered for only the end of the Horizon time period. If the Horizon time period is over 10 years, it is recommended to enter an appropriate Exit Value for Year 10 as well as the end of the Horizon time period. This is because the *ThruThink Deal Evaluation* evaluates only the first 10 years of a deal and will use the Hard Asset liquidation value for the Exit Value at year 10 if there is not a Market Value available. Therefore, to ensure a more accurate analysis, it is advisable to enter an Exit Value for both Year 10 and the end of the Horizon time period.

Question: What will be used as the Exit Value at year 10 if there is no Market Value available?
Answer: If there is no Market Value available at year 10, the *ThruThink Deal Evaluation* will use the Hard Asset liquidation value as the Exit Value.

Question: What is the purpose of the Exit Strategy process?
Answer: The purpose of the Exit Strategy process is to allow the user to input a possible, expected, or required Market Value sale for the company in a given year during the analysis horizon period. This allows for the evaluation of the potential return on investment and helps in assessing the value of the business. The Market Value can be expressed as a multiple of EBITDA or a flat amount for the company, or a combination of both. The Exit Value does not affect the cash flow of the company but is used in various analysis factors to calculate the "what if" annual return for the investment in the company. It is an important input for the Equity Analysis and the Summary of Salient Results reports.

Question: How can the Market Value be expressed?
Answer: The Market Value can be expressed in two ways: as a multiple of EBITDA or as a flat amount. 
When expressing the Market Value as a multiple of EBITDA, it represents the value of the business based on its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. This method is useful for evaluating the ongoing performance of the company as it automatically reflects its performance.
Alternatively, the Market Value can be expressed as a flat amount. This is a set number that represents the value of the business or other assets, such as real estate, that are included in the overall value of the company.
In some cases, a combination of both methods can be used. This is helpful when the business value includes a value based on a multiple of EBITDA and also includes other asset values that should be expressed as a set number.
It is important to enter the appropriate Market Value for each year of the analysis horizon, with particular emphasis on the last year of the time horizon and Year 10 if the horizon is greater than 10 years. The Market Value input does not affect the cash flow of the company but is used in various analysis factors within the *ThruThink* software to calculate "what if" annual returns on the investment in the company.

Question: Does the Exit Value change the cash flow of the Company?
Answer: No, the Exit Value does not change the cash flow of the Company. The Exit Value is entered on the Exit Strategy page and is used for analysis purposes. It represents a possible, expected, or required Market Value sale for the Company in a given year during the analysis horizon period. The Exit Value is used in various analysis factors in *ThruThink* to calculate "what if" annual returns for the investment in the Company. However, it does not affect the actual cash flow of the Company. The Exit Value will flow into the Equity Analysis found on the Snap Shot Summary and the Summary of Salient Results reports.

Question: Which reports will the Exit Value flow into?
Answer: The Exit Value entered in the Exit Strategy page will flow into the Equity Analysis found on the Snap Shot Summary and the Summary of Salient Results reports.

Question: Why is it important to enter a factor for each Horizon year in the analysis?
Answer: It is important to enter a factor for each Horizon year in the analysis because several analysis factors in *ThruThink* require an annual market value for the Company for each year. This is necessary in order to express a "what if" annual return for the investment in the Company. By entering a factor for each year, the User can accurately assess the potential value and performance of the Company over the entire analysis horizon period. 
While it is crucial to enter a factor for each year, the most important inputs are the last year of the time horizon and Year 10 if the horizon is greater than year 10. These inputs are particularly significant because they determine the Exit Value for the Company or Deal. The Exit Value represents a possible, expected, or required Market Value sale for the Company in a given year during the analysis horizon period. 
The Market Value can be expressed as a multiple of EBITDA or a flat amount for the Company, or a combination of both. This combination is useful when the business value includes a value for the business that can be expressed as a multiple of EBITDA and other asset value such as real estate that should be expressed as a set number. 
It is worth noting that the Exit Value does not change the cash flow of the Company. Instead, it flows into the Equity Analysis found on the Snap Shot Summary and the Summary of Salient Results reports. Therefore, by entering a factor for each Horizon year, the User can obtain a comprehensive and accurate analysis of the Company's potential value and returns over time.

Question: What is the advantage of using the EBITDA Multiple method of valuation?
Answer: The advantage of using the EBITDA Multiple method of valuation is that it provides a relatively simple measure of value on an ongoing basis as it automatically reflects the performance of the company. This method allows the user to express the market value of the company as a multiple of its EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization). By using this method, the user can easily track the value of the company over time based on its financial performance. Additionally, the EBITDA Multiple method is useful when the business value includes a value for the business that can be expressed as a multiple of EBITDA and other asset value such as real estate that should be expressed as a set number. Overall, this method simplifies the valuation process and provides a clear and consistent measure of the company's value.

Question: Can value factors for only a single year be entered in the analysis?
Answer: Yes, value factors for only a single year can be entered in the analysis. The Exit Strategy process in the *ThruThink Deal Evaluation* allows the user to input a possible, expected, or required Market Value sale for the Company in a given year during the analysis horizon period. The Market Value can be expressed as a multiple of EBITDA or a flat amount for the Company, or a combination of both. If the analysis is set to reflect a scenario for a single year, then value factors for only that year may be entered. However, it is recommended to enter a factor for each of the Horizon years of the analysis to accurately express a "what if" annual return for the investment in the Company.
