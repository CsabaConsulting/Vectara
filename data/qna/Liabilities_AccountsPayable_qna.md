Question: What are Accounts Payable?
Answer: Accounts Payable (A/P) are normal operating expenses incurred by the Company that have not yet been paid. They are a common part of the normal operations of most companies. When an expense is incurred and not paid, the amount of the expense becomes an Account Payable. A/P's are categorized by the number of days they are outstanding, such as Less than 30 days, 30-60 Days, and Over 60 Days. The Beginning Accounts Payable are obligations of the Company as of the Company purchase date. They will flow into the 1st year cash flow calculations and be paid in accordance with the User Inputs in the Accounts Payable Future Terms Set-up. The Accounts Payable Percent Calculation is a measure of A/P as a percent of COGS, Overhead, and Increase in Inventory expense. The actual percent is derived from a weekly cash flow analysis and is divided by the Annual COGS, Overhead, and increase in Inventory. The percentage calculated from Year 3 is used for the balance of the Horizon Years.

Question: How are expenses recognized in relation to Accounts Payable?
Answer: Expenses are recognized when they are incurred, not necessarily when they are paid. When an expense is incurred and not paid, it becomes an Accounts Payable (A/P).

The recognition of expenses in relation to Accounts Payable allows for accurate tracking of the company's financial obligations and helps in managing cash flow.

Question: How are Accounts Payable categorized?
Answer: Accounts Payable are generally categorized into three categories: 
1. Less than 30 days: This category includes expenses that are expected to be paid within 30 days of the invoice date. These are typically short-term liabilities that need to be settled in the near future.
2. 30-60 days: This category includes expenses that are expected to be paid between 30 and 60 days from the invoice date. These are also short-term liabilities, but they have a slightly longer payment period compared to the first category.
3. Over 60 days: This category includes expenses that are expected to be paid more than 60 days from the invoice date. These are typically long-term liabilities that may take a longer time to settle.
The specific categorization of Accounts Payable may vary depending on the company's policies and payment terms negotiated with suppliers. The user has the flexibility to select the number of days to pay for each category.

Question: What are Beginning Accounts Payable?
Answer: Beginning Accounts Payable refers to the obligations of a company as of the purchase date or effective date. These are normal operating expenses that have been incurred but have not yet been paid. When an expense is incurred and not paid, it becomes an Accounts Payable (AP). Beginning Accounts Payable are typically not part of an asset-only company purchase, but if they are, the purchase price should be increased and the APs are shown as a source of financing the company purchase. These Beginning APs will flow into the first-year cash flow calculations and be paid according to the user inputs in the Accounts Payable Future Terms Set-up.

Question: How are Beginning Accounts Payable treated in a funding analysis?
Answer: In a funding analysis, Beginning Accounts Payable (A/P) are considered obligations of the company as of the company purchase date (Effective Date). Typically, Beginning A/Ps are not part of an asset-only company purchase. However, if they are included in the purchase, the purchase price should be increased accordingly, and the A/Ps are then shown as a source of financing the company purchase.
The Beginning A/Ps will flow into the first-year cash flow calculations and be paid in accordance with the user inputs in the Accounts Payable Future Terms Set-up. If the user has chosen to override Sales and Cost of Goods Sold with a direct EBITDA override, the A/P will be the prior year's ending balance, and there will be no change in A/P with an EBITDA override. However, the A/Ps can still be manually adjusted using an Adjusting Journal Entry (AJE).
The Accounts Payable Percent Calculation, which can be found in the Weekly Cash Flow Detail, determines the percentage of A/Ps as a proportion of COGS, Overhead, and Increase in Inventory expenses. This calculation is based on the Accounts Payable - Future Set-Up Factors chosen by the user. The actual percentage is derived from the final A/P balance obtained from a weekly cash flow analysis, divided by the annual COGS, Overhead, and increase in Inventory.
The percentage of A/Ps relative to total expenses for the year will be small when expenses are consistently paid on a weekly basis. However, if expenses are paid on a monthly basis, the percentage will still be small but larger than the percentage based on a weekly pay cycle. As the days to pay the A/Ps, as entered on the Accounts Payable Future Terms Set-Up page, increase over 30 days, the percentage of total annual expenses will naturally increase. The percentage calculated from Year 3 is used for the balance of the Horizon Years in the funding analysis.

Question: What happens to Accounts Payable if an EBITDA override is in effect?
Answer: If an EBITDA override is in effect, the Accounts Payable (A/P) will be the prior year's ending balance. This means that there will be no change in the A/P with an EBITDA override. However, it is possible to manually change the A/P by using an Adjusting Journal Entry (AJE).

Question: Where can the Accounts Payable Percent Calculation be found?

Question: What factors determine the Accounts Payable Percent Calculation?
Answer: The factors that determine the Accounts Payable Percent Calculation are the Accounts Payable - Future Set-Up Factors chosen by the User. These factors can be found in the Information Browser. The actual percent is derived from the final Accounts Payable balance obtained from a weekly cash flow analysis, divided by the Annual Cost of Goods Sold (COGS), Overhead, and increase in Inventory expenses. 
The percentage is influenced by the frequency of expense payments. If expenses are consistently paid on a weekly basis, the percentage will be small as it represents a percentage of weekly expenses as Accounts Payable divided by the total expenses for the year. If expenses are paid on a monthly basis, the percentage will still be small but slightly larger than the percentage based on a weekly pay cycle.
Additionally, the days to pay the Accounts Payable, as entered on the Accounts Payable Future Terms Set-Up page, also impact the percentage. As the days to pay the Accounts Payable increase beyond 30 days, the percentage of total annual expenses will naturally increase.
It is important to note that the percentage calculated from Year 3 is used for the balance of the Horizon Years.

Question: How does the payment frequency affect the Accounts Payable Percent Calculation?
Answer: The payment frequency affects the Accounts Payable Percent Calculation by determining the size of the percentage. When expenses are paid consistently on a weekly basis, the percentage will be small as it is a percent of weekly expenses divided by the total expenses for the year. On the other hand, when expenses are paid consistently on a monthly basis, the percentage will still be small but larger than the number based on a weekly pay cycle. 
Additionally, as the days to pay the Accounts Payable increase over 30 days, the percentage of total annual expenses will also increase. This means that if the payment terms for Accounts Payable extend beyond 30 days, the percentage calculated from Year 3 will be used for the balance of the Horizon Years. 
In summary, the payment frequency affects the Accounts Payable Percent Calculation by influencing the size of the percentage, with weekly payments resulting in smaller percentages compared to monthly payments.

Question: How does the days to pay affect the Accounts Payable Percent Calculation?
Answer: The days to pay the Accounts Payable (A/P) affects the Accounts Payable Percent Calculation. The Accounts Payable Percent Calculation is a measure of the A/P as a percentage of the Cost of Goods Sold (COGS), Overhead, and Increase in Inventory expenses. 
When expenses are consistently paid on a weekly basis, the percentage number will be small as it represents the A/P divided by the total expenses for the year. Similarly, when expenses are consistently paid on a monthly basis, the percentage number will still be small but slightly larger than the number based on a weekly pay cycle.
However, as the days to pay the A/P increase over 30 days, the percentage of total annual expenses will also increase. This means that if the company takes longer to pay its A/P, the A/P as a percentage of the total expenses will be higher.
It is important to note that the percentage calculated from Year 3 is used for the balance of the Horizon Years, indicating that the A/P percent calculation remains consistent throughout the projected period.
