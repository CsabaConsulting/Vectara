Question: How many different ways can Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) items be entered by the User?
Answer: Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) items can be entered by the User in four different ways. These include:
1. A Percent of Sales in Step 3: The User can input the COGS as a percentage of sales in Step 3 of the process.
2. A Cash Flow Control page override adjustment as a Percent of Sales input: The User can override the COGS percentage entered in Step 3 by inputting a different percentage on the Cash Flow Control page.
3. A Cash Flow Control page override adjustment as a Whole Number input: The User can also override both the Step 3 and Cash Flow Control percentage inputs by entering a whole number for COGS on the Cash Flow Control form.
4. Individually Identified Items: For Years 1-3, the User can enter specific Individually Scheduled COGS on the Individually Scheduled COGS Input page. The COGS for the Horizon Years will default to the same input as Year 3, unless overridden with an individual input for the total of the Individually Identified Items in any of the applicable Horizon Years. This allows the User to set a pattern using Years 1-3 and add separate COGS in addition to any percentage or whole number inputs.

Question: What is the first way to enter COGS items?
Answer: The first way to enter Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) items is by specifying a percentage of sales in Step 3.

Question: How can the % of Sales for COGS entered in the Cash Flow Control page affect the Step 3 % inputs?
Answer: The % of Sales for COGS entered in the Cash Flow Control page can override the Step 3 % inputs. This means that if a user enters a specific % of Sales for COGS on the Cash Flow Control page, it will take precedence over the % inputs entered in Step 3. In other words, the COGS calculation will be based on the % of Sales entered in the Cash Flow Control page instead of the Step 3 % inputs. This allows users to have more control over the COGS calculation by adjusting it based on their specific needs and circumstances.

Question: What is the second way to enter COGS items?
Answer: The second way to enter COGS items is through a Cash Flow Control page override adjustment as a Percent of Sales input. This means that the user can input a specific percentage of sales for COGS on the Cash Flow Control page, which will override any percentage inputs entered in Step 3.
---
Question: How can a Whole Number input for COGS on the Cash Flow Control form affect the Step 3 and Cash Flow Control % COGS inputs?
Answer: A Whole Number input for COGS on the Cash Flow Control form will override both the Step 3 and Cash Flow Control % COGS inputs. This means that if a Whole Number input is entered for COGS on the Cash Flow Control form, it will take precedence over any percentage inputs entered in Step 3 or the Cash Flow Control page. In other words, the Whole Number input will be used as the definitive value for COGS, disregarding any percentage inputs that may have been entered.
---
Question: What is the third way to enter COGS items?
Answer: The third way to enter COGS items is through a Cash Flow Control page override adjustment as a Whole Number input. This means that on the Cash Flow Control form, you can input a specific whole number value for COGS, which will override both the percentage inputs from Step 3 and the Cash Flow Control percentage inputs for COGS.

Question: How can Individually Identified COGS be entered?
Answer: Individually Identified COGS can be entered in the Individually Scheduled COGS Input page for each of Years 1-3. For these years, specific details for the Individually Scheduled COGS can be provided. However, for the Horizon Years (years beyond Year 3), the same input as Year 3 will be used unless overridden with an individual input for the total of the Individually Identified Items in any of the applicable Horizon Years. The purpose of using Years 1-3 is to establish a pattern, and the Individually Identified COGS will be separate and in addition to any % of Sales or Whole Number COGS inputs.
---
Question: In which years can the detail for specific Individually Scheduled COGS be entered?
Answer: The detail for specific Individually Scheduled COGS can be entered in Years 1-3.
---
Question: What will be used as the input for the balance of the Horizon Years if no individual input is provided?
Answer: If no individual input is provided for the balance of the Horizon Years, the input for the balance of those years will be the same as the input for Year 3.

Question: How are Individually Identified COGS different from % of Sales or Whole Number COGS inputs?
Answer: Individually Identified COGS are different from % of Sales or Whole Number COGS inputs in the way they are entered and calculated. 
% of Sales COGS inputs allow the user to enter a percentage of the sales revenue as the cost of goods sold. This percentage is typically entered in Step 3 of the financial planning process. 
Whole Number COGS inputs, on the other hand, allow the user to enter a specific whole number value as the cost of goods sold. This value is typically entered on the Cash Flow Control page and overrides the % of Sales COGS inputs.
Individually Identified COGS, however, provide a more detailed approach. For Years 1-3, the user can enter specific items or categories of cost of goods sold on the Individually Scheduled COGS Input page. These individually identified items are separate and in addition to any % of Sales or Whole Number COGS inputs. The balance of the Horizon Years (years beyond Year 3) will use the same input as Year 3, unless overridden with an individual input for the total of the Individually Identified Items in any of the applicable Horizon Years.
In summary, Individually Identified COGS allow for a more granular and specific input of cost of goods sold items, while % of Sales and Whole Number COGS inputs provide more general and broad approaches to calculating the cost of goods sold.
