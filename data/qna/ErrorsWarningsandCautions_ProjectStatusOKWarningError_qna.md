Question: What should the User do if the Project Status is "Error"?
Answer: If the Project Status is "Error", the User should look at the Error Summary for a list of the Errors. These errors can be input errors made by the User that result in negative balances or calculation errors or inconsistencies identified by the program. If the errors can be corrected by the User, they will be noted on the Error Summary. However, if the status says "Error" and there are no errors listed in the Error Summary, it indicates that the errors are caused by calculation inconsistencies within the program. In such cases, the User should bring these errors to the attention of *ThruThink* by contacting them through the means directed on the Contact page. It is important to note that the User should first correct any input errors caused by them before reporting the errors to *ThruThink*. Additionally, if after correcting any User-caused input errors, the status still shows "Error", the User can use the Edit/Undo feature to backtrack through the User inputs and identify which inputs are causing the error. This information will be very helpful when reporting errors to *ThruThink*.
