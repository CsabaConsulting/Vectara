Question: What are Origination Points in the ThruThink analysis?
Answer: Origination Points in the ThruThink analysis refer to fees charged by the lender for multi-year loans at the time of loan origination. These fees are often expressed as points, with one point equaling 1% of the loan amount. If there is a straight dollar amount for the fee, it should be included as a transaction expense and due diligence fee under the Step 7 Inputs.
In the ThruThink analysis, Origination Points are amortized and added to the Amortized Assets on the Balance Sheet. They are also included along with transaction and due diligence expenses and amortized over the years for goodwill and transaction expenses in the Tax Rate and Depreciation Input page. This means that Origination Points are not expensed in the year they are paid, but rather expensed over the life of the amortized asset as Amortization Expense.
It is important to note that Origination Points are only applicable to individual Transaction Sheet Loans and cannot be specified for Individually Scheduled Debt Items. However, an adjusting journal entry (AJE) may be made to the Amortized Assets for this purpose. If the fee is to be charged annually, it should not be included as Origination Points but rather as an operating expense for Year 1 and subsequent years if applicable.

Question: Are Origination Points applicable to all types of loans in the ThruThink analysis?
Answer: No, Origination Points are only applicable to multi-year loans in the ThruThink analysis. They are fees charged by the lender at the time of loan origination and are expressed as a percentage of the loan amount. These points are amortized and added to the Amortized Assets on the Balance Sheet, along with Transaction and Due Diligence Expenses. The amortization of Origination Points occurs over the life of the Amortized Asset as Amortization Expense. It is important to note that Origination Points are not expensed in the year they are paid, but rather spread out over the loan's duration. However, if there is a straight dollar amount for a fee, it should be included as a Transaction Expense and Due Diligence Fee under the Step 7 Inputs. It is also worth mentioning that Origination Points are only applicable to individual Transaction Sheet Loans and cannot be specified for Individually Scheduled Debt Items. In such cases, an adjusting journal entry (AJE) may be made to account for Origination Points in the Amortized Assets.

Question: How can Origination Points be specified for Individually Scheduled Debt Items?
Answer: Origination Points cannot be directly specified for Individually Scheduled Debt Items in the ThruThink analysis. However, an adjusting journal entry (AJE) can be made to the Amortized Assets to account for Origination Points associated with these debt items. This means that if you want to include Origination Points for Individually Scheduled Debt Items, you would need to manually adjust the Amortized Assets using an AJE.
