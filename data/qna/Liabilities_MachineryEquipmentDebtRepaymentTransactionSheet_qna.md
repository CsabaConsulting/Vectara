Question: How are annual payments on the Equipment Debt calculated?
Answer: Annual payments on the Equipment Debt are calculated by adding the interest on the outstanding balance of the loan at the prior year end to the principal. The principal amount is determined by dividing 1 by the remaining years of the loan. For example, if the loan has a duration of 10 years, the principal repayment for year 1 would be 1/10 or 10%, year 2 would be 1/9 or 11.1%, and year 3 would be 1/8 or 12.5%. 
It is important to note that the principal repayment calculation is flexible and adjusts with the remaining years of the loan if additional advances or payments are made during the life of the loan. This provision allows for a Line of Credit situation, providing the ability to make additional advances and paybacks. It also allows the user to adjust the loan amounts based on cash flow needs and test different scenarios in future years.
If a Balloon Year is indicated by the user, the remaining balance of the loan, including any advances made in the previous year, will be paid off in the Balloon Year.
If the user requires other principal repayment options such as amortized, level principal, monthly payments, quarterly payments, etc., they should utilize the Individually Scheduled Item Input option.

Question: What is the formula for calculating the principal repayment for each year of a loan?
Answer: The formula for calculating the principal repayment for each year of a loan is as follows: 
Principal Repayment = 1 / Remaining Years of the Loan
For example, if you have a 10-year loan, the principal repayment for the first year would be 1/10 or 10%. In the second year, it would be 1/9 or approximately 11.1%. And in the third year, it would be 1/8 or 12.5%. 
It's important to note that if there are any additional advances or payments made during the life of the loan, the loan duration is reset to the original term, and the principal repayment calculation adjusts accordingly based on the remaining years of the loan. 
If you require other principal repayment options such as amortized, level principal, monthly payments, quarterly payments, etc., it is recommended to use the Individually Scheduled Item Input option.
