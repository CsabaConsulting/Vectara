Question: What are Origination Points in the *ThruThink* analysis?
Answer: Origination Points in the *ThruThink* analysis refer to fees charged by the lender for multi-year loans at the time of loan origination. These fees are often expressed as points, with one point equaling 1% of the loan amount. If there is a straight dollar amount for the fee, it should be included as a transaction expense and due diligence fee under the Step 7 Inputs.
In the *ThruThink* analysis, Origination Points are amortized and added to the Amortized Assets on the Balance Sheet. They are also included in the amortization of goodwill and transaction expenses on the Tax Rate and Depreciation Input page. This means that Origination Points are not expensed in the year they are paid, but rather expensed over the life of the amortized asset as Amortization Expense.
It is important to note that Origination Points are only applicable to individual Transaction Sheet Loans and cannot be specified for Individually Scheduled Debt Items. However, an adjusting journal entry (AJE) can be made to the Amortized Assets for this purpose. If the fee is to be charged annually, it should be included as an operating expense for Year 1 and subsequent years if applicable.
