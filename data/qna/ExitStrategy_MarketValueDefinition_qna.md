Question: What are the two ways to input the Market Value of a company sale in the Exit Strategy Input page?
Answer: In the Exit Strategy Input page, there are two ways to input the Market Value of a company sale: EBITDA Multiple and Direct Value. The EBITDA Multiple method involves expressing the economic value of the company's operations as a multiple of its EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization). This multiple can range from 2-3 to over 10, depending on factors such as the stability of the present EBITDA and the level of risk. A higher multiple may be justified if there is a good case for substantial EBITDA growth, while a lower multiple may be appropriate if EBITDA growth is declining or the risk of EBITDA volatility is high.
The Direct Value method, on the other hand, allows the user to directly input a specific value for the company or the assets being purchased. This is useful for companies with a significant amount of hard assets, such as real estate, note receivables, intellectual property, or patents, whose value is not fully represented by the operating earnings of the company. The Direct Value can be used in conjunction with the EBITDA Multiple method or separately as a total value for the company.
It is important to note that the Cash balance of the company and its Debt are typically not included in a Market Valuation. However, for a net benefit from a Market Value Exit Sale, Cash is added to the Market Value, and Debt is subtracted, along with any excluded assets as described above.

Question: How is the economic value of a company's operations often expressed?
Answer: The economic value of a company's operations is often expressed as a multiple of the company's EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization). This multiple is determined based on the stability of the present EBITDA and the level of risk associated with future EBITDA growth. The EBITDA multiple can range from a low multiple of 2-3 to a high multiple of over 10 for private companies. A higher multiple is justified if there is a good case for substantial EBITDA growth at an acceptable risk level, while a lower multiple is justified if EBITDA growth is declining or the risk of EBITDA volatility is relatively high.

Question: What determines the actual multiple used for the EBITDA Multiple method of valuation?
Answer: The actual multiple used for the EBITDA Multiple method of valuation is determined by how stable the present EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization) of the company is going forward given a certain risk level. If there is a good case that the EBITDA will increase substantially in the future at an acceptable risk level, then a higher multiple is justified. On the other hand, if the EBITDA growth is declining or the risk of EBITDA volatility is relatively high, a lower multiple is justified. The specific multiple used can range from a low multiple of 2-3 to a high multiple of over 10 for private companies.

Question: How can a Direct Value be used in the Exit Strategy Value?
Answer: A Direct Value can be used in the Exit Strategy Value as a standalone measure of the company's worth or in conjunction with the EBITDA Multiple method. When using a Direct Value, the user simply enters a specific number that represents the value of the company or the assets being purchased. This approach is particularly useful for companies that have a significant amount of hard assets, such as real estate, note receivables, intellectual property, patents, or any other assets whose value is not fully reflected in the company's operating earnings.
By incorporating a Direct Value, the user can account for the value of these specific assets that may not be adequately captured by the EBITDA Multiple method alone. This allows for a more comprehensive assessment of the company's overall worth. Additionally, the Direct Value can be used alongside the EBITDA Multiple method to provide a total value for the company, taking into consideration both the operating earnings and the specific asset values.
It is important to note that when using the Direct Value approach, the user should ensure to enter an appropriate Exit Value for Year 10 as well as the end of the Horizon time period, especially for Horizon time periods exceeding 10 years. This is because the *ThruThink Deal Evaluation* tool evaluates only the first 10 years of a deal and will utilize the Hard Asset liquidation value for the Exit Value at year 10 if a Market Value is not available. 
Lastly, it is worth mentioning that the Cash balance of the company and its Debt are typically not included in a Market Valuation. However, for a net benefit calculation from a Market Value Exit Sale, Cash is added to the Market Value, and the Debt, along with any excluded assets as described in the documentation, is subtracted.

Question: What types of assets are commonly represented by a Direct Value?
Answer: Assets such as real estate, note receivables, intellectual property or patents, and any other assets that have a value not fully represented by the operating earnings of the company are commonly represented by a Direct Value.

Question: What should be entered for Horizon time periods over 10 years in terms of Exit Value?
Answer: For Horizon time periods over 10 years, it is recommended to enter an appropriate Exit Value for Year 10 as well as the end of the Horizon time period. The *ThruThink Deal Evaluation* evaluates only the first 10 years of a deal and will use the Hard Asset liquidation value for the Exit Value at year 10 if there is not a Market Value available. Therefore, to ensure accurate evaluation and consideration of the Exit Value, it is important to provide an appropriate Exit Value for Year 10 and the end of the Horizon time period.

Question: Are the Cash balance and Debt of the Company included in a Market Valuation?
Answer: No, the Cash balance and Debt of the Company are not usually included in a Market Valuation. In a Market Value Exit Sale, the Cash is added to the Market Value and the Debt is subtracted, along with any excluded assets described in the Exit Strategy Input page. The Market Value of a company sale can be inputted using either the EBITDA Multiple method or the Direct Value method. The EBITDA Multiple method calculates the economic value of the company's operations as a multiple of its EBITDA, while the Direct Value method allows the user to enter a specific value for the company or its assets.

Question: How is the net benefit calculated in a Market Value Exit Sale?
Answer: In a Market Value Exit Sale, the net benefit is calculated by adding the Cash balance of the company to the Market Value and subtracting the Debt along with any excluded assets. The Cash balance and Debt are not typically included in a Market Valuation. This means that to determine the net benefit, the Cash is added to the Market Value, and then the Debt and any excluded assets (such as A/R, Inventory, Notes Receivable, Equipment, or Real Estate) are subtracted. This calculation helps to determine the actual financial gain or benefit that can be obtained from the Market Value Exit Sale.
