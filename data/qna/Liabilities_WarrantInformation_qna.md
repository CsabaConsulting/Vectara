Question: What are warrants in the context of the ThruThink analysis?
Answer: In the context of the ThruThink analysis, warrants refer to rights given to an outside party, known as the warrant holder, that allow them to own a certain percentage of the company at a future point in time. These warrants are issued by the company to the warrant holder at no cost to the warrant holder. Warrants are often given to a subordinated debt lender as an incentive to make a loan. They provide the lender with the ability to participate in the future success of the company. The value of the warrants is calculated based on the selected multiple of EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) and the company's balance sheet. The warrant exercise year is the year in which the warrants are to be paid to the warrant holder, and it is a user input in the sub debt setup. The analysis includes the estimation of cash flow requirements at the time of the warrant exercise year and helps the company measure the potential future value of the warrants and forecast cash availability for warrant buyback.

Question: How are warrants issued in this analysis?
Answer: In this analysis, warrants are issued by the company to an outside party called the Warrant Holder. The warrants are given to the Warrant Holder at no cost. The purpose of issuing warrants is to provide an incentive for a Subordinated Debt lender to make a loan to the company. The warrants give the Subordinated Debt lender the ability to own a certain percentage of the company in the future. The Warrant Holder in this analysis is the Sub Debt lender. It is important to note that the amount of equity given to the Warrant Holder should be balanced between the initial equity and the Warrant Holder's risk position. The analysis allows the company to measure the potential future value of the warrants and forecast the cash availability to fund the warrant buyback.

Question: What generates warrant liability?
Answer: Warrant liability is generated from the warrant provisions of the Subordinated Debt for the Transaction Sheet Subordinated Debt (Individual Loan) or the Individually Scheduled Subordinated Debt (Multiple Loans) that is directed to either the Transaction Sheet or the Existing Company. In this context, warrants are often given to a Subordinated Debt lender as an inducement to make the loan. The security for the Sub Debt loan is the value of the company after the Senior Secured Debt is paid, which involves a greater level of risk. As partial compensation for the added risk, warrants provide the Sub Debt lender the ability to participate in the future success of the company. The warrant holder in this analysis is the Sub Debt lender.

Question: Who are warrants often given to as an inducement to make a loan?
Answer: Warrants are often given to Subordinated Debt lenders (Sub Debt) as an inducement to make a loan.

Question: How is the warrant value calculated in this analysis?
Answer: The warrant value in this analysis is calculated based on the indicated percentage of the company issued as a warrant (% of Company Value) at the end of each year. The calculation takes into account the selected multiple of EBITDA (EBITDA Sale Multiple) and the company's EBITDA, as well as cash and liabilities except for accrued warrant value. 
To calculate the warrant value, the % of Company Value is multiplied by the Company Value (EBITDA Sale Multiple times the Company's EBITDA), and then cash is subtracted from this amount along with all liabilities except accrued warrant value. 
It is important to note that the warrant value is based on the EBITDA of the year prior to the warrant exercise year and the balance sheet of the company as of year-end just prior to the warrant exercise year. 
For more detailed information and specific calculations, you can refer to the Sub Debt Warrant Detail page in the documentation.

Question: Where can the details of the warrant calculations and company value assumptions be found?
Answer: The details of the warrant calculations and company value assumptions can be found in the Sub Debt Warrant Detail page.

Question: What is the warrant exercise year?
Answer: The warrant exercise year refers to the year in which the warrants are to be paid to the warrant holder. It is a user input in the sub debt setup input page. The warrant exercise year is intended to reflect when the warrant holder will exercise the warrant, although this may not be known by the user at the time of the debt setup. The input becomes a best guess, estimate, or forecast by the user. In the analysis, the warrants are then purchased from the warrant holder (sub debt lender) by the company in the exercise year. As the warrant is paid, the accrued warrant value liability is reduced, and company cash is reduced.
---
Question: Can the resulting warrant amount be paid in installments?
Answer: Yes, the resulting warrant amount can be paid in installments. For the Transaction Sheet Sub Debt Input, the option to pay the warrant amount in a lump sum or in annual installments is available. The number of payments can be negotiated at the time the warrants are issued by the company. This feature allows the company to spread out the impact of paying the warrant upon exercise. However, it is important to note that this option is not available for the Individually Scheduled Sub Debt Inputs, as these are generally existing warrants established prior to the Effective Date.

Question: How does the warrant exercise year impact the company's liabilities and cash?
Answer: The warrant exercise year refers to the year in which the warrants issued by the company are to be paid to the warrant holder. During this year, the company purchases the warrants from the warrant holder, resulting in certain impacts on the company's liabilities and cash.
Firstly, the warrant exercise year leads to a reduction in the accrued warrant value liability. The accrued warrant value represents the liability created by the warrant provisions of the subordinated debt. As the warrants are paid off, the accrued warrant value liability decreases.
Secondly, the warrant exercise year also results in a reduction in the company's cash. This is because the company uses its cash reserves to purchase the warrants from the warrant holder. As a result, the company's cash balance decreases.
It is important to note that the specific impact on liabilities and cash will depend on the terms negotiated between the company and the warrant holder. For the transaction sheet sub debt input, the resulting warrant amount can be paid in a lump sum or in annual installments, which allows the company to spread out the impact of paying the warrant upon exercise. However, for individually scheduled sub debt inputs, these options may not be available as these warrants are generally established prior to the effective date.
Overall, the warrant exercise year has the effect of reducing the accrued warrant value liability and decreasing the company's cash balance as the warrants are purchased from the warrant holder.

Question: Are there tax consequences calculated for the issuance or buy back of warrants?
Answer: No, there are no tax consequences calculated for any gain or loss on the issuance or buy back of the warrants.

Question: What is the purpose of including warrants in the analysis?
Answer: The purpose of including warrants in the analysis is to provide an estimate of the cash flow requirement on the company at the time of the warrant exercise year. Warrants are rights given to an outside party (warrant holder) that enable them to own a certain percentage of the company in the future. In this analysis, warrants are issued by the company to the warrant holder at no cost. 
Warrants are often given to a subordinated debt lender as an inducement to make a loan. The security for the subordinated debt loan is the value of the company after the senior secured debt is paid, which involves a greater level of risk. As partial compensation for the added risk, warrants provide the subordinated debt lender the ability to participate in the future success of the company. 
By including warrants in the analysis, the company can measure the possible future value of the warrants and better analyze the balance between the amount of initial equity and the warrant holder's risk position. This analysis can also be used by the subordinated debt lender to determine the best time to exercise the warrant, as it provides an internal rate of return for each year based on value assumptions.

Question: What should the company be careful of when issuing warrants?
Answer: When issuing warrants, the company should be careful about the amount of equity being given to the warrant holder. It is important to strike a balance between the initial equity and the warrant holder's risk position. The analysis should be used to measure the potential future value of the warrants and to better analyze this balance. Additionally, the company should consider the future cash availability to fund the warrant buyback. It is crucial to carefully assess the impact of issuing warrants on the company's equity structure and forecast the cash flow requirement at the time of the warrant exercise year.
---
Question: How can the analysis be used by the sub debt lender?
Answer: The analysis can be used by the sub debt lender to calculate the Internal Rate of Return (IRR) for each year based on the value assumptions provided. This includes the value calculations for the warrants. By analyzing the IRR, the sub debt lender can determine the best time to exercise the warrants. This information can assist the lender in making informed decisions regarding the timing of exercising the warrants and maximizing their potential return on investment.

Question: What factors should be individually reviewed and adjusted to improve cash flow?
Answer: To improve cash flow, there are several factors that should be individually reviewed and adjusted:
1. Sales and Expenses: Future sales and expenses should be carefully reviewed and adjusted based on available historical performance information. It is important to consider the company's plan and strategy for the future when making adjustments. However, it is crucial to avoid "wishful thinking" or arbitrary adjustments that may artificially improve profitability and cash flow.
2. Debt Structure: The company's debt structure should be reviewed. Adjustments can be made by increasing the debt amount, extending the repayment terms, or making the debt interest-only. These adjustments can help ease the impact on cash flow in the short term.
3. Loans and Capital Expenditures: Each loan shown on the Cash Flow Control should be analyzed and adjusted where appropriate. New loans can also be created if necessary. Capital expenditures should be reviewed, and the need for non-financed capital expenditure should be critiqued. Financing options can be explored to conserve cash.
4. Accounts Receivable Average Days to Collect: The time it takes to collect accounts receivable has a direct impact on cash flow. Lowering the average time to collect accounts receivable will improve cash flow. The average weeks to collect accounts receivable can be adjusted by the user.
5. Inventory Average Days to Hold: The length of time inventory is held before being sold (inventory turn) affects cash flow. Lowering the average time inventory is held will improve cash flow. The average weeks to hold inventory can be adjusted by the user.
6. Accounts Payable Aging: The frequency of paying accounts payable can impact cash flow on a weekly, monthly, or seasonal basis. Adjusting the payment frequency for accounts payable can help manage cash flow.
7. Individually Scheduled Items: Individually scheduled items such as accounts receivable, inventory creation and use, cost of goods sold, other expenses, and income can have an impact on cash flow. These items allow for input by month to adjust cash flow more specifically within the year.
By reviewing and adjusting these factors, a company can improve its cash flow position and ensure better financial stability.

Question: How can the average days to collect accounts receivable be adjusted?
Answer: The average days to collect accounts receivable can be adjusted by the user using the Average Weeks to Collect input page. By inputting the desired average weeks to collect, the user can effectively lower or increase the average time it takes to collect accounts receivable. This adjustment can have a direct and significant impact on cash flow, as lowering the average time to collect accounts receivable will improve cash flow.
---
Question: How can the average days to hold inventory be adjusted?
Answer: The average days to hold inventory can be adjusted by the user using the Average Weeks to Hold Inventory input page. By inputting the desired number of weeks to hold inventory, the user can effectively lower or increase the average time inventory is held, which will have a direct impact on cash flow. Lowering the average time inventory is held will improve cash flow, while increasing it will have the opposite effect. Adjusting this parameter allows the user to fine-tune the cash flow projections based on their specific inventory management strategy and goals.
---
Question: How can the frequency of paying accounts payable be adjusted?
Answer: The frequency for paying accounts payable can be adjusted in the Accounts Payables Set Up form. This form allows the user to specify the payment frequency on a weekly, monthly, or seasonal basis. By adjusting the payment frequency, the user can effectively manage the cash flow impact of accounts payable payments.
---
Question: What are the individually scheduled items that can be adjusted to affect cash flow?
Answer: The individually scheduled items that can be adjusted to affect cash flow are Accounts Receivable (A/R), Inventory Creation and Use, Cost of Goods Sold, Other Expenses, and Income. These items allow for input by month to adjust cash flow more specifically within the year. It is available in years 1-3 of the analysis. By adjusting these items, businesses can have a better understanding of their cash flow and make necessary changes to improve their financial situation.
