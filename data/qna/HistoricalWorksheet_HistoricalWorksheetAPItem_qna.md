Question: What is the purpose of the A/P column on the Historical Worksheet?
Answer: The purpose of the A/P column on the Historical Worksheet is to allow the user to designate each expense item as an Accounts Payable (A/P) type item. By entering "YES" or "NO" in the A/P column, the user can indicate whether an expense item can be paid in accordance with the A/P terms, such as 30, 60, or other specified number of days to pay. This feature helps the user to determine the percentage of A/P type items in the total expenses. This percentage can be useful in setting up the Accounts Payable - Future Terms Set-Up in the *ThruThink* application, as it provides an idea of the proportion of expenses that can be paid at a later date. It is important to note that labor expenses would typically not be treated as A/P type items and should be marked as "NO" in the A/P column.
