Question: What is amortization?
Answer: Amortization refers to the process of spreading out the cost of a non-tangible asset over a period of years instead of expensing it all in one year. In the context of the *ThruThink* analysis, there are two categories for amortized assets. The first category includes Capitalized Transaction Expenses and Goodwill, which both use the same life period. The second category consists of Amortized Assets identified on the Capital Expenditures Input page, and separate life periods in years may be used for each category.
Both categories of amortized assets are capitalized to the Amortized Asset category on the Balance Sheet. Each year of the life period, an Amortization Expense is calculated using the same life period for both accrual expenses and cash basis expenses. By default, a life period of 15 years is used for both asset categories, unless the user chooses to change it.
It is important for users to consult with their tax advisors to determine the appropriate life period to use for amortization. It is worth noting that amortization terms only apply to the Transaction Sheet Assets and new Capital Expenditures. The amortization expense for existing company assets is entered by the user as whole numbers and is not calculated automatically.
