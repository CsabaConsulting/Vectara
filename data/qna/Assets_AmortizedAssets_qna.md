Question: How is the amount paid for a company that exceeds the value of its assets at the time of purchase treated in the ThruThink Analysis?
Answer: In the ThruThink Analysis, the amount paid for a company that exceeds the value of its assets at the time of purchase is treated as Goodwill and capitalized to the Amortized Asset category on the Balance Sheet. This Goodwill amount is then amortized over the years for Goodwill and Transaction Expenses in the Tax Rate and Depreciation Input page. This means that the excess amount paid for the company is spread out and recognized as an expense over a period of time rather than being expensed immediately.

Question: How are amounts from the Capital Expenditure Input page treated in the ThruThink Analysis?
Answer: In the ThruThink Analysis, amounts from the Capital Expenditure Input page that are indicated as Amortized Assets are treated in a specific manner. These amounts are added to the Amortized Assets on the Balance Sheet and are then amortized over the years for Amortized Capital Expenditure Assets. This amortization is done in the Tax Rate and Depreciation Input page. Essentially, the ThruThink Analysis recognizes these amounts as assets that will be gradually expensed over time, taking into account the tax rate and depreciation factors.
