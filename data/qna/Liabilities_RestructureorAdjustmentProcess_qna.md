Question: What is the purpose of the Restructure Process?
Answer: The purpose of the Restructure Process is to allow the user to represent an item on the original Existing Company Balance Sheet and then "restructure" that item before the Effective Date. This process is primarily used to illustrate a "Restructure Plan" of Short Term Debt, such as Accounts Receivable, Inventory, or Other Current Debt, to Long Term Debt in order to increase Working Capital. The Restructure Process is intended to show a "detail trail" for pre Effective Date adjustments or restructures. It is important to note that if a corresponding adjustment to another debt category is not made, there may be an equity imbalance, which would require an Equity Adjustment to be made. However, adjustments to Equity are not recommended and must be made carefully.

Question: What is the significance of the "Existing Company-Adjustment" Show On selection?
Answer: The "Existing Company-Adjustment" Show On selection is a feature that allows the user to indicate that a specific item on the original Existing Company Balance Sheet has been restructured or adjusted before the Effective Date. By selecting this option for a particular item, it will cause the corresponding Adjustment addition to be displayed in the "Adjustment Column" on the Existing Company Balance Sheet.
This feature is important because it helps maintain a clear and detailed trail of pre-Effective Date adjustments or restructures. It ensures that the Adjusted Balances, which include the restructuring or adjustment, are the ones used in the analysis.
It is worth noting that if a corresponding adjustment to another debt category is not made, it may result in an equity imbalance. In such cases, an Equity Adjustment will need to be made to rectify the imbalance. However, it is recommended to exercise caution when making adjustments to equity and to do so carefully.
