Question: What are Accounts Receivables?
Answer: Accounts Receivables are generated when sales are made to customers without receiving the cash for the sale. In accrual accounting, a sale is booked when the customer purchases or takes delivery of the item or product, regardless of whether the customer has paid for the sale. The sale then becomes an obligation from the customer to pay the company for the item or product purchased, which becomes the Accounts Receivable. Accounts Receivables are aged based on how old they are from the point of sale, typically categorized as less than 30 days, 30-60 days, 60-90 days, and over 90 days. Accounts Receivables can also be pledged as collateral for an Accounts Receivable Loan, with the loan value typically being 50%-80% of the Accounts Receivables less than 60 days old. Accounts Receivables over 60 days are often considered ineligible for collateral.

Question: How are Accounts Receivables aged?
Answer: Accounts Receivables are aged based on how old they are from the point of sale. This aging is often expressed in categories such as: 
- Less than 30 days
- 30-60 days
- 60-90 days
- Over 90 days
The aging calculation for Accounts Receivables takes into account user inputs for the average weeks to collect the Accounts Receivables. The calculation determines the percentage of invoices that fall into each aging category based on the average weeks outstanding for each category. 
For beginning Accounts Receivables invoices that are 0-30 days old, the calculation divides a standard 4 weeks for the 0-30 day category by the weighted average of the user inputs for the beginning A/R weeks outstanding. The collection of these invoices will start in week #1 and be collected evenly over the weeks indicated.
For new sales invoices that are 0-30 days old, the calculation divides a standard 4 weeks for the 0-30 day category by the user input for the future average weeks outstanding for the total Accounts Receivables. The collection of these invoices will start in the week indicated and be collected evenly over the weeks indicated.
The calculation for invoices that are 30-60 days old is the leftover calculation after the 0-30 day category and the over 60 day category (loan reserve) have been set. The days to collect for 30-60 day invoices are determined to make the average between the three categories match the average weeks to carry for the total Accounts Receivables. This number will not go negative and will become zero in such cases.
For beginning Accounts Receivables invoices that are 30-60 days old, the indicated percentage will start collection in week #1 and be collected evenly over the weeks indicated. For new sales invoices that are 30-60 days old, the indicated percentage will start collection in the week indicated and be collected evenly over the weeks indicated.
There is a default maximum of 8 weeks to begin collection for 30-60 day old sales. The lesser of the default maximum or the calculated amount will be used.
For beginning Accounts Receivables invoices that are over 60 days old, the indicated percentage will start collection in week #1 and be collected evenly over the weeks indicated. For new sales invoices in the over 60 day category, the indicated percentage will start collection in the week indicated and be collected evenly over the weeks indicated. The week to start collection for the over 60 day invoices will be calculated with the average weeks for the total Accounts Receivables as an overriding factor.

Question: How are Accounts Receivables often used as collateral?
Answer: Accounts Receivables are often used as collateral for an Accounts Receivable Loan. The Loan to Value (LTV) for an Accounts Receivable Loan is typically 50%-80% of the Accounts Receivables that are less than 60 days old. Accounts Receivables that are over 60 days old are often considered ineligible for collateral. This means that a company can borrow money using their outstanding Accounts Receivables as security. The lender will assess the value of the Accounts Receivables and provide a loan based on a percentage of that value. If the borrower fails to repay the loan, the lender can seize the Accounts Receivables to recover their funds.

Question: What are the calculations based on for Accounts Receivable aging?
Answer: The calculations for Accounts Receivable aging are based on user inputs for the average weeks to collect the Accounts Receivable. 
For beginning A/R invoices that are 0-30 days old, the percentage of invoices in this category is calculated by dividing a standard 4 weeks for the 0-30 day category by the weighted average of the user inputs for the beginning A/R weeks outstanding by category for the total A/R. The collection of the beginning A/R will start in week #1 and be collected evenly over the weeks indicated.
For new sales invoices that are 0-30 days old, the percentage of invoices in this category is calculated by dividing a standard 4 weeks for the 0-30 day category by the user input for the future average weeks outstanding for the total A/R. The collection of the A/R will start in the week indicated and be collected evenly over the weeks indicated.
The calculation for A/R sales invoices that are 30-60 days old is the leftover calculation after the 0-30 day category has been set and the over 60 day (loan reserve) category has been set. The days to collect for 30-60 day invoices are determined by the number of days required to make the average between the three categories match the average weeks to carry for the total A/R. This number will not go negative and will become zero in such cases.
For beginning A/R sales invoices that are 30-60 days old, the indicated percentage of beginning A/R will start collection in week #1 and be collected evenly over the weeks indicated. For new sales invoices that are 30-60 days old, the indicated percentage will start collection in the week indicated and be collected evenly over the weeks indicated.
There is a default maximum of 8 weeks for the weeks to begin collection for 30-60 day old sales. The lesser of the default maximum or the calculated amount will be used.
For beginning A/R sales invoices over 60 days old, the indicated percentage of beginning A/R will start collection in week #1 and be collected evenly over the weeks indicated.
For new sales invoices in the over 60 day category, the collection will be made up of the loan reserve amounts. The indicated percentage will start collection in the week indicated and be collected evenly over the weeks indicated. The week to start collection for the over 60 day invoices will be calculated with the average weeks for the total A/R as an overriding factor. For example, if the average weeks for the total A/R is 4 weeks, then the over 60 day category cannot be more than 4 weeks.

Question: How is the collection of Accounts Receivables calculated for invoices 0-30 days old?
Answer: The collection of Accounts Receivables for invoices 0-30 days old is calculated based on the user inputs for the average weeks to collect the Accounts Receivable. The calculation involves dividing a standard 4 weeks for the 0-30 day category by the weighted average of the user inputs for the beginning A/R weeks outstanding by category for the total A/R. The collection of the beginning A/R will start in week #1 and be collected evenly over the weeks indicated. For new sales invoices 0-30 days old, the indicated percentage of invoices that are 0-30 days is calculated by dividing a standard 4 weeks for the 0-30 day category by the user input for the future average weeks outstanding for the total A/R. The collection of the A/R will start in the week indicated and be collected evenly over the weeks indicated.

Question: How is the collection of Accounts Receivables calculated for invoices 30-60 days old?
Answer: The calculation for the collection of Accounts Receivables for invoices that are 30-60 days old is based on the average number of days required to collect the total Accounts Receivables. The calculation takes into account the percentages of invoices in the 0-30 days category and the over 60 days category that have already been set. 
The number of days to collect for the 30-60 day invoices is determined by finding the average between the three categories (0-30 days, 30-60 days, and over 60 days) to match the average weeks to carry for the total Accounts Receivables. This number will not go negative and will become zero in such cases.
For beginning Accounts Receivable sales invoices that are 30-60 days old, the indicated percentage of beginning Accounts Receivables will start collection in week #1 and be collected evenly over the weeks indicated. For new sales invoices that are 30-60 days old, the indicated percentage will start collection in the indicated week and be collected evenly over the weeks indicated.
There is a default maximum of 8 weeks to begin collection for 30-60 day old sales invoices. The lesser of the default maximum or the calculated amount will be used.

Question: How is the collection of Accounts Receivables calculated for invoices over 60 days old?
Answer: For invoices over 60 days old, the collection of Accounts Receivables is calculated based on the indicated percentage of the beginning A/R and new sales invoices. The indicated percentage of the beginning A/R will start collection in week #1 and be collected evenly over the weeks indicated. For new sales invoices, the indicated percentage will start collection in the week indicated and be collected evenly over the weeks indicated.
The week to start collection for the Over 60 Day invoices will be calculated with the Average Weeks for the Total A/R as an overriding factor. For example, if the Average Weeks for the total A/R is 4 weeks, then the Over 60 Day category cannot be more than 4 weeks.
It is important to note that the Accounts Receivables over 60 days are often considered ineligible for certain purposes, such as being pledged as collateral for an Accounts Receivable Loan.

Question: When is income reported in the calculations?
Answer: Income is reported in the calculations when sales are made, regardless of whether the cash has been received or not. Accounts Receivable (AR) are generated when sales are made but the cash has not been received yet. The calculation takes into account the factors that govern the weeks it will take to collect the cash from the sale, which can range from 0 to 52 weeks.
---
Question: When are expenses recognized in the calculations?
Answer: Expenses are recognized in the calculations when they are incurred, but not necessarily paid. This means that when inventory is built or manufactured, cash is used but it will not be recognized as an expense until it is sold (COGS). The Inventory Asset Input page allows the user to indicate how long the inventory will be carried until sold, ranging from 0 to 52 weeks. As accounts receivables are collected and inventory is sold, the accounts receivable and inventory loans will be paid down by the amount of the accounts receivable collection and inventory being used.
---
Question: How is cash generated in relation to Accounts Receivables?
Answer: Cash is generated in relation to Accounts Receivables through the collection of outstanding payments from customers. When sales are made and customers do not immediately pay for the purchases, it creates an Accounts Receivable. As customers make payments towards their outstanding balances, cash is received, which includes the conversion of inventory into cash. This cash received from the collection of Accounts Receivables does not create income. Additionally, when new Accounts Receivables are generated and new inventory is purchased or manufactured, the Accounts Receivable and Inventory loans will increase as determined by the terms set up by the user.
---
Question: How is cash generated in relation to Inventory?
Answer: Cash is generated in relation to Inventory through the process of selling inventory. When inventory is sold, cash is received from the customer as payment for the sale. This cash does not create income, but it represents the conversion of inventory into cash. As new inventory is purchased or manufactured, the Accounts Receivable (AR) and Inventory loans will increase according to the terms set up by the user. So, the cash generated from the sale of inventory helps to pay down the AR and Inventory loans.

Question: What happens if an EBITDA Override is in effect?
Answer: If an EBITDA Override is in effect, it means that the user has chosen to override the sales and cost of goods sold (COGS) with a direct EBITDA override. In this case, the accounts receivable (AR) and inventory balance will be based on the prior year's ending balance, adjusted for any current year write-offs. This means that there will be no change in cash required due to changes in AR, inventory, or accounts payable (A/P), except for the current year's write-offs of AR and inventory.
It's important to note that there are no adjusting journal entries (AJEs) available for AR or inventory in this scenario. However, adjustments can still be made using the write-off process, which can be accessed through the Transaction Sheet Asset Input for AR and inventory write-off inputs.

Question: What adjustments can be made for Accounts Receivables and Inventory write-offs?
Answer: Adjustments for Accounts Receivables and Inventory write-offs can be made using the Write Off process. The Transaction Sheet Asset Input provides inputs for AR and Inventory Write Offs. This means that if there are any outstanding Accounts Receivables or Inventory items that are deemed uncollectible or unsellable, they can be written off as a loss. This adjustment will reduce the value of the Accounts Receivables and Inventory on the balance sheet and reflect the actual value of these assets. However, it is important to note that there are no AJE's (Adjusting Journal Entries) available for Accounts Receivables or Inventory, so any adjustments must be made through the Write Off process.
