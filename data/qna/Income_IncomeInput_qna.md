Question: What are the two options for entering growth projections for income?
Answer: The two options for entering growth projections for income are:
1) The User may make projections for Years 1-3 in the Historical Worksheet process. After making these projections, the User will have the option to input the projections into the Cash Flow Control page. If the User chose to input the projections from the Historical Worksheet into the Cash Flow Control, then the Step 3 input should be skipped.
2) The User may make % growth inputs over Base Sales on the Step 3 input page along with % of Sales inputs for expenses for each of the years 1-3 and one constant growth input that will be used for all remaining years of the Horizon period.

Question: What options are available for entering income and expense growth on the Step 3 input page?
Answer: On the Step 3 input page, there are several options available for entering income and expense growth projections:
1) The user can make projections for Years 1-3 in the Historical Worksheet process. If these projections are inputted into the Cash Flow Control page, the Step 3 input should be skipped.
2) The user can make percentage growth inputs over Base Sales for each of the years 1-3. Additionally, they can input a percentage of sales for expenses for each of these years. There is also an option to input a constant growth rate that will be used for all remaining years of the Horizon period.
3) The user can make percentage growth inputs over Base EBITDA for each of the years 1-3. They can also input a constant growth rate for EBITDA that will be used for all remaining years of the Horizon period.
4) There are override inputs available for each of these Step 3 inputs on the Cash Flow Control page. The user can choose to skip the inputs on the Step 3 page and directly make projections for income/expense or EBITDA on the Cash Flow Control page. Any inputs made on the Cash Flow Control page will override the inputs made on the Step 3 page.
5) Detailed individual inputs for income and expense can be made using the Individually Scheduled Item options on the Step 3 input page. These options provide more specific input choices that are not available on the Step 3 page or the Cash Flow Control page.
It's important to note that the Individually Scheduled Item results and all income/expense or EBITDA growth inputs on the Step 3 page will be included on the Cash Flow Control page. However, if these inputs are overridden by inputs directly on the Cash Flow Control page, they will no longer be visible from the Cash Flow Control page.

Question: What options are available for entering EBITDA growth on the Step 3 input page?
Answer: On the Step 3 input page, there are two options available for entering EBITDA growth projections. 
1) The User may make percentage growth inputs over Base EBITDA for each of the years 1-3. This allows the User to input specific growth rates for each year within the initial three years of the projection period.
2) The User may also make one constant growth input for EBITDA that will be used for all remaining years of the Horizon period. This option allows for a single growth rate to be applied consistently for the years beyond the initial three years.
These options provide flexibility in projecting EBITDA growth and allow the User to customize the growth rates based on their specific needs and expectations.

Question: Can the user override the Step 3 inputs on the Cash Flow Control page?
Answer: Yes, the user has the option to override the Step 3 inputs on the Cash Flow Control page. If the user chooses to make projections for Income/Expense or EBITDA directly on the Cash Flow Control page, these inputs will override any inputs made on the Step 3 input page. Additionally, if the user has made override inputs for each of the Step 3 inputs on the Cash Flow Control page, they will continue to have the opportunity to make adjustments on that page, which will then override the inputs made on the Step 3 input page.

Question: How can the user make detailed individual inputs for income and expense?
Answer: The user can make detailed individual inputs for income and expense by using the "Individually Scheduled Item" options on the Step 3 input page. This option provides the user with individualized input options that are not available on the Step 3 input page or on the Cash Flow Control page. 
By selecting the "Individually Scheduled Item" option, the user can enter specific details for each income and expense item separately. This allows for a more granular and customized approach to projecting income and expenses. 
It is important to note that the results of the individually scheduled items, along with all the income and expense or EBITDA growth inputs on the Step 3 input page, will be displayed separately and included on the Cash Flow Control page. However, if the user overrides these inputs by directly inputting information on the Cash Flow Control page, the individually scheduled item inputs will no longer be visible from the Cash Flow Control page.

Question: Where will the Individually Scheduled Item results and all the income and expense or EBITDA growth inputs be included?
Answer: The Individually Scheduled Item results and all the income and expense or EBITDA growth inputs will be included on the Cash Flow Control page.

Question: What happens if the inputs on the Cash Flow Control page override the Step 3 inputs?
Answer: If the inputs on the Cash Flow Control page override the Step 3 inputs, the overridden inputs will no longer be visible from the Cash Flow Control page. This means that any growth projections for income and expenses or EBITDA that were initially entered on the Step 3 input page will be replaced by the inputs made directly on the Cash Flow Control page. The Cash Flow Control page takes precedence over the Step 3 inputs, allowing the user to make adjustments and modifications to the projections as needed.
