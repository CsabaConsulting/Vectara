Question: What is the purpose of the Individual Item Schedule?
Answer: The purpose of the Individual Item Schedule is to provide the user with the option to identify and track specific items of Subordinated Debt in more detail. It allows the user to input the remaining payments, interest rate, and type of payment for each item. The schedule calculates the amount of each remaining payment and summarizes it into annual amounts. The interest becomes an expense, the principal reduces the debt on the Balance Sheet, and both the interest and principal amounts reduce the Cash Flow. The schedule also provides options for repayment, such as Interest Only, Amortized Level Payment, and Level Principal plus Interest. Additionally, the user can choose where the item flows to, such as the Transaction Sheet, Existing Company, or Existing Company-Adjustment, depending on the specific needs and requirements.

Question: What information does the User input for each Item balance?
Answer: For each Item balance, the User inputs the following information:
1. Remaining Payments: The number of actual payments left for the life of the loan, up to a maximum of 240 payments. If left blank, 20 years of payments will be used.
2. Type of Payment: The type of payment option chosen, which can be one of the following:
   - 0: Interest Only with no principal paid
   - 1: Amortized-Level payment containing both principal and interest over the term of the loan
   - 2: Level Principal Payment plus Interest
   - 3: Interest Only with all of the principal paid with the last payment (balloon)
3. Payment for Amortized Loans, Principal amount for Principal plus Interest Loans: If the payment over the indicated periods is not enough to pay off principal and interest, the balance owed will be paid off in the last pay period. For the amortized payment option, if no amount is inserted, an automatic calculation based on the given factors will be used. For Level Principal plus Interest, if no principal payment amount is inserted, interest only will be calculated.
4. Number of Payments per Year: The number of payments made per year, ranging from 1 to 12. If left blank, the default is 1 payment per year.
5. Month Payment is Due: This entry applies only to debt with annual payments (1 per year). For items other than annual payments, the default month due will be Month "12". The month the payment is due is the month number from the Effective Date. For example, if the Effective Date is March 31 and the payment is due in June, then the Month Period Due would be 3.
6. Year of Funding: Indicates the year the loan is funded. For the Beginning Effective Date, it can be left blank or a '0' can be entered. A '1' would indicate the loan is funded during Year 1, and so on. For monthly cash flow purposes, loan funding will be at the midpoint of the indicated year. Accrued interest for the remaining half of the year will be calculated and included in Accrued Interest Income and Accrued Interest Receivable on the Balance Sheet.
7. Funding Month: If the loan is funded during Years 1-3, the User may identify which month during those years the loan is funded. If no month is indicated, the loan will be funded in month 12 of the Year indicated by default.

Question: How are the remaining payments calculated and summarized?
Answer: The remaining payments for each item of Subordinated Debt are calculated and summarized into annual amounts. The user inputs the remaining payments, the interest rate, and the type of payment for each item. The amount of each remaining payment is then calculated based on these inputs. The interest portion of each payment is recorded as an expense, while the principal portion reduces the debt on the Balance Sheet. Both the interest and principal amounts also reduce the Cash Flow.

Question: What are the four separate repayment options on the Individually Scheduled Item Input page?
Answer: On the Individually Scheduled Item Input page, there are four separate repayment options:
1. Interest Only: This option allows for payments that only cover the interest on the loan, with no principal being paid.
2. Amortized Level Payment: This option involves making level payments that include both principal and interest over the term of the loan.
3. Level Principal plus Interest: With this option, the payments consist of a level principal amount along with the interest.
4. Interest Only with Balloon Payment: This option allows for interest-only payments throughout the term of the loan, with the entire principal amount being paid off in the last payment (balloon payment).

Question: What happens when the User chooses the Transaction Sheet for the Show On selection?
Answer: When the User chooses the Transaction Sheet for the Show On selection, the individual item of Subordinated Debt will be sent to the Transaction Sheet. The Transaction Sheet can be used for various purposes such as "Purchase the Target Company", "Purchase the Existing Company", or "The Existing Company Purchases the Target Company". By selecting this option, the debt item will be included in the transaction and used accordingly based on the specific transaction scenario.
---
Question: What happens when the User chooses the Existing Company for the Show On selection?
Answer: When the User chooses the Existing Company for the Show On selection, the individual item of Subordinated Debt will be sent to the Existing Company Input Section. It will be included in the Beginning Existing Company Balance Sheet. This means that the debt will be considered as part of the existing debt of the company.
If the User is purchasing the Existing Company, sending debt to the Transaction Sheet will be in addition to the Existing Company's debt. It can represent the added debt required to provide the funds to purchase the Existing Company. The debt on the Transaction Sheet will be added to the Existing Company's debt after the Effective Date.
By choosing the Existing Company option, the User can effectively manage and track the debt of the company and incorporate it into the financial statements and balance sheet of the Existing Company.
---
Question: What is the purpose of the Existing Company-Adjustment option for the Show On selection?
Answer: The purpose of the Existing Company-Adjustment option for the Show On selection is to allow the user to add debt items to the Existing Company in order to "restructure" the Beginning Existing Company debt structure. This option becomes useful when an existing Company Debt needs to be paid off with a new debt in accordance with a restructure plan. By selecting this option, the user can input the individual item of subordinated debt into the Existing Company Input Section, but it will be placed in the Adjustment Column next to the Beginning Existing Company Inputs. This allows for the restructuring of the debt before the Effective Date, and the future years will reflect the results of the debt restructure.

Question: What does the "Year of Funding" indicate?
Answer: The "Year of Funding" indicates the year in which the loan is funded. It is used to determine the timing of the loan funding for cash flow purposes. If the loan is funded during the beginning effective date, the "Year of Funding" can be left blank or entered as '0'. If the loan is funded during Year 1, it can be indicated as '1', and so on. For monthly cash flow purposes, the loan funding will be considered to occur at the midpoint of the indicated year. The accrued interest for the remaining half of the year will be calculated and included in the accrued interest income and accrued interest receivable on the balance sheet.
---
Question: How is the funding month of the loan determined?
Answer: The funding month of the loan can be determined by the user. If the loan is funded during Years 1-3, the user has the option to identify which month during those years the loan is funded. If no month is indicated, the loan will be funded in month 12 by default.

Question: What is the maximum number of payments allowed for the life of the loan?
Answer: The maximum number of payments allowed for the life of the loan is 240 payments.

Question: What are the different types of payment options?
Answer: On the Individually Scheduled Item Input page, there are four separate repayment options for Subordinated Debt:
1. Interest Only: This option allows for payments that only cover the interest on the loan, with no principal being paid off.
2. Amortized Level Payment: This option involves making level payments that include both principal and interest over the term of the loan. The payment amount is calculated based on the factors given.
3. Level Principal plus Interest: With this option, the payment includes both principal and interest, but the principal payment amount remains constant throughout the term of the loan. If no principal payment amount is inserted, interest only will be calculated.
4. Interest Only with Balloon Payment: This option allows for interest-only payments throughout the term of the loan, with the entire principal amount being paid off in the last payment (balloon payment).
---
Question: What happens if the payment over the indicated periods is not enough to pay off principal and interest?
Answer: If the payment over the indicated periods is not enough to pay off both principal and interest, the remaining balance owed will be paid off in the last payment period. This means that for amortized payment options, if the payment amount is not sufficient to cover the full principal and interest, the remaining balance will be paid off in the final payment. For level principal plus interest payment options, if no principal payment amount is inserted, only the interest will be calculated and paid.
---
Question: What does the "Number of Payments per Year" entry refer to?
Answer: The "Number of Payments per Year" entry refers to the frequency at which payments are made towards the loan. The user is required to enter the number of payments made in a year, which can range from 1 to 12. If this entry is left blank, the default value will be 1 payment per year. It is important to note that the maximum number of payments allowed for the life of the loan is 240.

Question: How is the month the payment is due determined?
Answer: The month the payment is due is determined based on the Effective Date and the input provided by the user. If the loan has annual payments, the default month due will be Month "12" for items other than annual payments. 
For example, if the Effective Date is March 31 and the payment is due in June, then the Month Period Due would be 3. 
If the Month Due is prior to month 12, the total payment will stay the same, but the amount of interest will vary and represent only the months of the year prior to and including the Month Due period. The balance of the payment will be principal and reduce the loan amount accordingly.
If this is a prior existing debt with annual payments, and the Month Due is greater than 12, the Start Month is the month the payment was last paid last year plus 12. The interest paid will be for the 12 months after last year's payment, which will include the periods from the prior year. On an accrual basis, interest paid this year for the months of last year will be reversed out of Accrued Interest Liability and accrued Interest expense. 
For example, if there is a payment for an existing debt due in April (Month 4) this year and was last paid in April of last year, use a month due of 16 (April = Month 4, 4 + 12 months back = 16). 12 months of interest will be paid and expensed to Interest Expense, and 8/12 of the interest paid will be reversed out or debited to Accrued Interest Liability and lower or credit Interest Expense.
An automatic accrual entry will be made crediting Accrued Interest and debiting Interest Expense for the months after the Month Period for each Year beginning with Year 1. This input is then automatically reversed the following year.

Question: How does the Month Due entry affect accrued interest income and receivable asset?
Answer: The Month Due entry determines the month in which the payment is due for debt with annual payments. If the Month Due is prior to Month Period 12, accrued interest income and receivable asset for the remaining periods of the year will be generated. 
If the Month Due is prior to Month Period 12, the total payment will stay the same, but the amount of interest will vary and represent only the months of the year prior to and including the Month Due period. The balance of the payment will be principal and reduce the loan amount accordingly.
For example, if the Effective Date is March 31 and the payment is due in June, then the Month Period Due would be 3. In this case, the interest calculation will only include the months of January, February, and March. The remaining payment will be applied towards the principal.
If the Month Due is greater than 12, it indicates that the payment is for a prior existing debt. In this case, the Start Month is the month the payment was last paid last year plus 12. The interest paid will be for the 12 months after last year's payment, which will include the periods from the prior year. On an accrual basis, interest paid this year for the months of last year will be reversed out of Accrued Interest Liability and accrued Interest expense.
For example, if there is a payment for an existing debt due in April (Month 4) this year and was last paid in April of last year, use a month due of 16 (April = Month 4, 4 + 12 months back = 16). 12 months of interest will be paid and expensed to Interest Expense, and 8/12 of the interest paid will be reversed out or debited to Accrued Interest Liability and lower or credit Interest Expense.
In summary, the Month Due entry affects the calculation of accrued interest income and receivable asset based on the timing of the payment and the periods for which the interest is accrued.

Question: How should accrued interest as an initial balance input be entered for prior existing debt?
Answer: For prior existing debt, accrued interest as an initial balance input should be entered as an Accrued Interest liability as of the beginning date in the Debt set up process. This means that the accrued interest should be recorded as a liability on the balance sheet. 
If the debt has annual payments, and the Month Due for the payment is prior to Month Period 12, the total payment will stay the same, but the amount of interest will vary and represent only the months of the year prior to and including the Month Due period. The balance of the payment will be principal and reduce the loan amount accordingly.
If the Month Due is greater than 12, indicating that the payment was last paid in the prior year, the Start Month is the month the payment was last paid last year plus 12. The interest paid will be for the 12 months after last year's payment, which will include the periods from the prior year. On an accrual basis, interest paid this year for the months of last year will be reversed out of Accrued Interest Liability and accrued Interest expense. 
For example, if there is a payment for an existing debt due in April (Month 4) this year and it was last paid in April of last year, use a month due of 16 (April = Month 4, 4 + 12 months back = 16). 12 months of interest will be paid and expensed to Interest Expense, and 8/12 of the interest paid will be reversed out or debited to Accrued Interest Liability and lower or credit Interest Expense.
An automatic accrual entry will be made crediting Accrued Interest and debiting Interest Expense for the months after the Month Period for each Year beginning with Year 1. This input is then automatically reversed the following year.

Question: How is the interest paid for the months of last year accounted for in the accrual basis?
Answer: If there is a payment for an existing debt due in a specific month this year and it was last paid in the same month of the previous year, the accrual basis accounting handles this as follows:
1. Input a "Month Due" greater than 12, where the "Start Month" is the month the payment was last paid last year plus 12. For example, if the payment is due in April (Month 4) this year and was last paid in April of last year, use a "Month Due" of 16 (April = Month 4, 4 + 12 months back = 16).
2. The interest paid will be for the 12 months after last year's payment, which includes the periods from the prior year.
3. On an accrual basis, the interest paid this year for the months of last year will be reversed out of the Accrued Interest Liability and accrued Interest Expense. This means that the interest expense for those months will be debited to the Accrued Interest Liability account and credited to the Interest Expense account.
4. For example, if there is a payment for an existing debt due in April (Month 4) this year and it was last paid in April of last year, 12 months of interest will be paid and expensed to the Interest Expense account. Additionally, 8/12 of the interest paid will be reversed out or debited to the Accrued Interest Liability account and credited to the Interest Expense account.
5. An automatic accrual entry will be made to credit the Accrued Interest account and debit the Interest Expense account for the months after the "Month Due" for each year, starting from Year 1. This accrual entry is then automatically reversed the following year.
For more detailed information on these entries, you can refer to the Interest information form.
