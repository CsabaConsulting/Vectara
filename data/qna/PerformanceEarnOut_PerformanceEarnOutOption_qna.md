Question: What happens if the Company performance does not increase?
Answer: If the Company performance does not increase, there will be a smaller or no Earn Out at all. This means that if the Earn Out option was used as an incentive for either the Seller or any other individual or entity, they will not receive the expected share of the future performance of the Company. The Earn Out amount is contingent upon the Company's performance, so if there is no improvement or growth in the Company's performance, there will be no Earn Out payment.

Question: What is the Performance Earn Out calculated as?
Answer: The Performance Earn Out can be calculated using two methods: 
1. Future EBITDA Performance Method: This method has two options. Option 1 increases the initial EBITDA multiple used to purchase the company per increment of EBITDA growth over the base EBITDA during the duration years. Option 2 increases the original purchase price of the company by an amount per increment of annual EBITDA result over the base EBITDA during the duration years. The calculation for the EBITDA Earn Out is based on the EBITDA growth over the duration period input divided by the increment of EBITDA growth input, multiplied by the EBITDA multiple and then multiplied by the initial company purchase base EBITDA.
2. % of Gross Sales Over Hurdle Method: This method pays the Performance Earn Out based on a certain percentage of company sales over a certain level. The percentage over sales hurdle is multiplied by annual gross sales that exceed the gross sales hurdle to determine the Performance Earn Out amount.
The specific inputs for each method, such as duration, maximum earn out amount, EBITDA multiple increase, increase in earn out amount, increment of EBITDA, % over sales hurdle, and gross sales hurdle, are used in the calculation of the Performance Earn Out.

Question: What are the two options for Method 1 - Future EBITDA Performance?
Answer: The two options for Method 1 - Future EBITDA Performance are:
1. Option 1: This option increases the initial EBITDA multiple used to purchase the company per increment of EBITDA growth over the EBITDA Base during the Duration years. The Earn Out amount is calculated by multiplying the EBITDA growth over the Duration Period Input by the Increment of EBITDA Growth Input and then multiplying it by the EBITDA Multiple. The resulting amount is then multiplied by the Initial Company Purchase Base EBITDA.
2. Option 2: This option increases the original Purchase Price of the company by an amount per increment of annual EBITDA result over the Base EBITDA during the Duration years. The Earn Out amount is calculated by multiplying the Increase in Earn Out Amount by the EBITDA Increment indicated over the Beginning EBITDA (Base EBITDA). The resulting amount is the Earn Out amount.
---
Question: Can both options be used at the same time?
Answer: No, both options cannot be used at the same time. The text states that only one method can be used at a time, and with the EBITDA performance method, only one option can be used at a time.

Question: How is the Earn Out amount calculated for Method 1, Option 1?
Answer: For Method 1, Option 1, the Earn Out amount is calculated based on the growth of EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization) over the Duration period. Here is the calculation process:
1. The User enters an EBITDA Multiple Increase number, which is a multiple of the EBITDA at the time of acquisition (Base EBITDA).
2. The User also enters an Increment of EBITDA Growth, which represents the amount of EBITDA growth required for the Earn Out to increase.
3. The Duration period is entered by the User, indicating the number of years the Earn Out calculations should apply.
4. The calculation for the EBITDA Earn Out Option 1 is as follows:
   - Calculate the EBITDA growth over the Duration period by subtracting the Base EBITDA from the EBITDA at the end of the Duration period.
   - Divide the EBITDA growth over the Duration period by the Increment of EBITDA Growth.
   - Multiply the result by the EBITDA Multiple Increase.
   - Multiply the EBITDA at the time of acquisition (Base EBITDA) by the calculated multiple increase.
   - The resulting amount becomes the Earn Out Note, which will be paid in accordance with the terms of the Seller Earn Out Note.
For example, if the initial EBITDA multiple is 5 and the EBITDA Multiple Increase is 0.25 for each $100,000 increase in EBITDA over the first 3 years (Duration) after purchase, and the Company's EBITDA increased a total of $300,000 during that period, the EBITDA multiple for which the Company purchase was based increases by 1.5, making the final multiple 6.5. The Earn Out Note would be calculated by multiplying the Base EBITDA by 1.5.

Question: How is the Earn Out amount calculated for Method 1, Option 2?
Answer: For Method 1, Option 2, the Earn Out amount is calculated based on the increase in EBITDA over the Duration years. The User inputs the Increase in Earn Out Amount, which represents the amount that the Earn Out should increase for each increment of EBITDA growth over the Base EBITDA. 
To calculate the Earn Out amount, the system multiplies the Increase in Earn Out Amount by the total EBITDA growth over the Duration years. For example, if the Increase in Earn Out Amount is $300,000 for each $1,000,000 in EBITDA growth over the Duration years, and the Company's EBITDA grows by $3,000,000 over that time, the Earn Out amount will be $900,000.
In summary, the Earn Out amount for Method 1, Option 2 is determined by multiplying the Increase in Earn Out Amount by the total EBITDA growth over the Duration years.
---
Question: What is the Increment of EBITDA Input used for?
Answer: The Increment of EBITDA Input is used to determine the increase in the Earn Out amount based on the growth of EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization) over the Base EBITDA. For each increment of EBITDA growth indicated over the Base EBITDA during the Earn Out Duration, the Earn Out amount will be increased by the amount specified in the Increment of EBITDA Input. This input is used in Method 1, Option 1 of the Performance Earn Out calculation. It allows the user to define the specific amount by which the Earn Out should increase for each increment of EBITDA growth.

Question: How does Method 2 - % of Gross Sales Over Hurdle Method work?
Answer: Method 2 - % of Gross Sales Over Hurdle Method is a way to calculate the Performance Earn Out based on a certain percentage of the company's sales that exceed a specified sales level, known as the Gross Sales Hurdle. 
To use this method, the user needs to input two values: the percentage (% Over Sales Hurdle) and the sales level (Gross Sales Hurdle). 
The % Over Sales Hurdle is the percentage that will be multiplied by the annual gross sales that exceed the Gross Sales Hurdle. The result of this calculation will determine the Performance Earn Out amount.
For example, let's say the % Over Sales Hurdle is set to 5% and the Gross Sales Hurdle is set to $1,000,000. If the company's annual gross sales reach $1,200,000, the amount that exceeds the Gross Sales Hurdle is $200,000. The Performance Earn Out amount would then be calculated as 5% of $200,000, which is $10,000.
This method allows the user to determine the desired level of Earn Out Incentive by testing and observing different levels of Sales Percent and Sales Hurdle.

Question: What is the Earn Out Duration Input used for?
Answer: The Earn Out Duration Input is used to indicate the number of years that the Performance Earn Out calculations should apply. It represents the duration period for which the Earn Out will be in place. This input is entered by the user and typically starts from the first year after the Beginning Date. The Earn Out calculations, whether based on Method 1 or Method 2, will be applicable for the specified duration period.
---
Question: Can a maximum lifetime cap be set for the Performance Earn Out?
Answer: Yes, a maximum lifetime cap can be set for the Performance Earn Out. The User has the option to enter a maximum cap on the amount calculated by either method of Earn Out calculation. If left blank, there will be no cap. If the User enters "0", the Earn Out will be capped at 0. This input can be found on the Performance Earn Out Input page.
---
Question: What is the Performance Earn Out Expense based on?
Answer: The Performance Earn Out Expense is based on the consideration of whether the Earn Out amount is considered part of the purchase price for the company or compensation for promised future performance by the seller. 
If the Earn Out amount is considered part of the purchase price, it will be capitalized and accrue to the Performance Earn Out Note. It will increase the Goodwill asset and be amortized (expensed) over the Goodwill amortization period, which is typically 15 years.
If the Earn Out amount is considered compensation or sharing of the benefit, it will be expensed in the Profit and Loss (P&L) statement in the year it is earned. The amount earned by the Earn Out holder will accrue to the Performance Earn Out Note and be reflected as an expense in the Income Statement as Other Expense. 
The treatment of the Performance Earn Out Expense can be selected by the user during the setup process. By default, if no specific input is provided, the Performance Earn Out is treated as part of a purchase incentive for the seller and is capitalized to Goodwill.

Question: How is the Earn Out amount treated if it is considered part of the purchase price?
Answer: If the Earn Out amount is considered part of the purchase price for the company, it will be capitalized and accrue to the Performance Earn Out Note. This will increase the Goodwill asset and be amortized (expensed) over the Goodwill amortization period, which is typically set at 15 years. In this case, the Earn Out amount will not be expensed in the year earned but will be included in the Accrual EBITDA on the Income Statement and set up as a Performance Earn Out Note Liability. The Earn Out payment will be reflected as a liability under the Seller Debt section on the Cash Flow Control page and will be paid out in the year it is due.

Question: How is the Earn Out amount treated if it is considered compensation or sharing of the benefit?
Answer: If the Earn Out amount is considered compensation or sharing of the benefit, it will be expensed in the Profit and Loss (P&L) statement in the year it is earned. The amount earned by the Earn Out holder will accrue to the Performance Earn Out Note, but will be expensed as Other Expense on the Income Statement. This means that the Earn Out amount will not be capitalized and accrued to the Goodwill asset. 
In the *ThruThink* analysis, when the Performance Earn Out is paid to one of the Equity Owners of the Company, the payments to the Equity Owner for the Performance Earn Out will be taxed as Ordinary Income to the Equity Owner when determining after-tax returns.

Question: How are payments on the Performance Earn Out reflected in the Cash Flow Control page?
Answer: Payments on the Performance Earn Out are listed under the Seller Debt section on the Cash Flow Control page. The Cash Flow Control page is organized in a way that the Earn Out payment is not reflected in the year it is earned, but in the year it is paid out. This means that the Cash Flow Control page will show the actual cash outflow for the Earn Out payment in the year it is made. The Earn Out payment will be categorized under the Seller Debt section, which is located after the EBITDA calculations on the Cash Flow Control page. It is important to note that since the Accrued (earned) Earn Out expense is included in the EBITDA calculations on the Income Statement, the EBITDA on the Income Statement and the EBITDA on the Cash Flow Control page may not match due to the inclusion or exclusion of the Earn Out calculations.
