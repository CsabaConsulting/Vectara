Question: What should be considered if the Cash Balance is minimal or negative over a sustained period of time?
Answer: If the Cash Balance is minimal or negative over a sustained period of time, there are several factors that should be considered:
1. Sales/EBITDA performance of the Company: It is important to evaluate the company's sales and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) performance. If the company is consistently generating low sales or experiencing declining profitability, it may indicate underlying issues with the business model or market conditions.
2. Debt structure: Assessing the company's debt structure is crucial. If the company has a high level of debt or is struggling to meet its debt obligations, it can put significant strain on the cash flow. Evaluating the terms of the debt, interest rates, and repayment schedule is necessary to understand the impact on the cash balance.
3. Amount of Equity: The amount of equity invested in the company should also be considered. Insufficient equity investment may result in a lack of financial resources to support the business operations and cover cash flow shortfalls. Adequate equity investment is essential for a healthy cash balance.
4. Combination of factors: It is important to analyze the interplay between these factors. A combination of poor sales performance, excessive debt, and inadequate equity can exacerbate cash flow issues. Evaluating the overall deal structure and considering potential adjustments may be necessary to ensure the viability of the company.
In summary, when the Cash Balance is minimal or negative over a sustained period of time, it is crucial to assess the sales/EBITDA performance, debt structure, amount of equity, and their combined impact. This evaluation will help determine if adjustments need to be made to the deal structure or if the overall viability of the company needs to be reconsidered.

By considering these factors, the user can determine if the deal structure or the deal itself makes sense in light of the minimal or negative cash balance.

If the Cash Balance is minimal or negative over a sustained period of time, it may indicate that the deal structure or the deal itself may not be financially viable.
By analyzing the Cash Balance and the cash flow results for the foreseeable future years, one can assess if the deal will generate enough cash to cover the Beginning Working Capital Cash requirement. If the Cash Balance is minimal or negative but recovers after an appropriate period of time, it may indicate that the deal structure is feasible, and the Beginning Working Capital Cash requirement can be determined based on the amount of Working Capital Cash required.
However, if the Cash Balance remains minimal or negative over a sustained period of time, it suggests that the Company's sales or EBITDA performance may not be sufficient to support the deal. In such cases, it is important to reconsider the underlying financial performance, debt structure, and the amount of Equity to determine if adjustments need to be made to make the deal financially viable.
In summary, evaluating the deal structure or the deal itself in relation to the Cash Balance involves assessing the Company's financial performance, debt structure, and Equity to determine if the deal makes sense and if the Cash Balance is sufficient to support the Beginning Working Capital Cash requirement.
