Question: How are adjustments made on the Cash Flow Control page applied to the category of loans?
Answer: Adjustments made on the Cash Flow Control page to the category of loans are applied in a specific manner. The most important item should be inputted as Loan #1, while the second and third items should be prioritized in order of importance as Loan #2 and Loan #3, respectively. 
Any adjustments made to this category of loans will be applied to the first Loan item initially. Once the first loan is paid off, the adjustments will then be applied to the second loan, and so on. 
If any draws are made on the Cash Flow Control page, they will only be applied to the first item. The same payments identified for each debt will be made, and any remaining balance at the end of the term for each debt will be paid off in a balloon payment. 
It is important to note that a Cash Flow adjustment or AJE that creates a negative loan amount will not be allowed. If a draw or AJE is made for a period after the loan term has expired and the original loan has been paid off, the amount of the Cash Flow adjustment or AJE will create a loan balance until adjusted again with either a Cash Flow Sheet adjustment or another AJE. 
Furthermore, interest will be paid on the balance annually until it is paid off with either another Cash Flow page adjustment or AJE. If individual activity (Payment or Draw) is required for each item separately, an AJE may be made to each specific item.

Question: How are draws made on the Cash Flow Control page applied to the category of loans?
Answer: Draws made on the Cash Flow Control page for the category of loans are applied to the first item only. This means that if there are multiple loans within the category, the draw amount will be deducted from the balance of the first loan item. The remaining loans will not be affected by the draw. It is important to note that draws can only be applied to the first item and cannot be distributed among multiple loans within the category.

Answer: If a draw or AJE is made after the loan term is expired and the original loan has been paid off, the amount of the draw or AJE will create a loan balance. This loan balance will remain until it is adjusted again with either a Cash Flow Sheet adjustment or another AJE. Interest will be paid on the balance annually until it is paid off with either another Cash Flow page adjustment or AJE.

Question: Can individual activity (Payment or Draw) be made for each item separately?
Answer: Yes, individual activity (Payment or Draw) can be made for each item separately. If needed, an Adjusting Journal Entry (AJE) may be made to each specific item. This allows for flexibility in managing and tracking payments or draws for each item of Other Transaction Debt.

Question: What can be done if individual activity is needed for each item separately?
Answer: If individual activity is needed for each item separately, an adjusting journal entry (AJE) can be made to each specific item. This means that adjustments or changes can be made to each loan item independently, allowing for specific actions such as payments or draws to be applied to each item separately. This provides flexibility in managing and tracking the activity of each loan item within the Other Transaction Debt category.
