Question: How can the user enter actuals for comparison purposes?
Answer: The user can enter actuals for comparison purposes by using the Month ID for Actual Inputs on the Projection to Actuals page. They can enter actuals for each month of Last Year and This Year by inputting the appropriate Month ID for Actuals. It is important to note that the Month ID for the Actual inputs is independent of the Month ID for Comparison. 
To ensure a valid comparison, the user must enter actuals for the same period as the comparison they want to make.

The Projection to Actual page provides tabs for viewing and printing the spread of the months' activity for the annual projections for Year 1, Last Year Actuals, This Year Actuals, and the Actual to Date and Projections for the balance of the Year.
