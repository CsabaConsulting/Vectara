Question: What is the definition of Un-Compensated Owner Contribution?
Answer: Un-Compensated Owner Contribution refers to the time and talent contribution made by the owner of a company that is not being paid for. It is considered critical to the operation of the company and is necessary for achieving the existing EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization) as represented in the Step 3 input. The value of the Un-Compensated Owner Contribution should be equivalent to what it would cost to replace such a contribution from an outside party. This input is used as a factor in the evaluation and deal score, but it does not change the current EBITDA or add expense to the projected EBITDA. It is important to consider the value of this contribution in order to properly assess the real value of the company or deal, as excluding it may result in the EBITDA value simply reflecting the owner having a "job".

Question: How is the value of Un-Compensated Owner Contribution determined?
Answer: The value of Un-Compensated Owner Contribution is determined based on the time and talent contribution that the owner makes to the operation of the company, which is not being paid to the owner. This contribution is critical to the company's operation and without it, the company's existing EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization) cannot be achieved. The value of the Un-Compensated Owner Contribution should be equivalent to what it would cost to replace this contribution from an outside party.
To determine the value of the Un-Compensated Owner Contribution, the owner should consider the operational time and talent contributions that would need to be replaced if the owner were not there. This value is entered as an input in the ThruThink Evaluation or the Un-Compensated Owner Contribution Input page. It is important to provide a realistic assessment of this contribution as it is a significant factor in evaluating the deal.
It is worth noting that the value of the Un-Compensated Owner Contribution should not be considered as the return on the owner's equity, which should be reflected in Step 8 of the evaluation process. Additionally, for proper evaluation of the company's past and future performance, the Historical EBITDA and projected EBITDA should also reflect any applicable Un-Compensated Owner Contribution. This can be done by adding an implied expense to the Historical Analysis or the projected EBITDA inputs, respectively. However, these adjustments are only for evaluation purposes and do not affect the actual EBITDA or cash flow projections.

Question: What is the purpose of including Un-Compensated Owner Contribution in the evaluation and deal score?
Answer: The purpose of including Un-Compensated Owner Contribution in the evaluation and deal score is to properly assess the real value of the company or deal. If the owner of the company is making significant contributions of their time and talent without being compensated, it is important to consider the value of this contribution in order to have an accurate evaluation. This adjustment is necessary because without it, the EBITDA value of the company or deal would simply reflect providing the owner a "job" rather than the true value of the business. By including the Un-Compensated Owner Contribution, the evaluation and deal score can take into account the critical operational contributions made by the owner, which can have a significant impact on the overall assessment of the company or deal.

Question: Where can the input for Un-Compensated Owner Contribution be entered?
Answer: The input for Un-Compensated Owner Contribution can be entered in two places:
1. ThruThink Evaluation Input: This input is entered through the ThruThink Evaluation Additional Information page or in the Quick Deal Input page. It reflects the Un-Compensated Owner Contributions that are not reflected in the current level of EBITDA as entered in Step 3. The amount entered here will not add expense or affect the cash flow projections but will be used as a factor in the ThruThink Evaluation.
2. Un-Compensated Owner Contribution Input: This input is entered on the Un-Compensated Owner Contribution Input page. It applies to both Historical EBITDA and Projected EBITDA inputs. If the Historical Analysis or Projected EBITDA does not reflect the value of the Owner's contribution to the Operations of the Company, an amount can be automatically added as an implied expense to make the EBITDA comparison and Company Value indication more accurate. However, it is important to note that this input for Projected EBITDA is only for the purposes of the ThruThink Evaluation calculations and will not add expense or a cash flow adjustment to the actual projected EBITDA. Actual expense or cash flow adjustments for Owner Compensation can be made using the Step 7 Inputs or the Owner Compensation Input page directly.

Question: How does the input for Un-Compensated Owner Contribution affect the cash flow projections?
Answer: The input for Un-Compensated Owner Contribution does not directly affect the cash flow projections. It is used as a factor in the evaluation and deal score, but it does not change the current EBITDA or add expense to the projected EBITDA. The purpose of this input is to assess the value of the owner's time and talent contributions to the operation of the company, which are not being compensated. It is important to consider this contribution in order to properly assess the real value of the company or deal. However, if there is a need to adjust the current or projected EBITDA to reflect the owner's compensation, it can be done in Step 3 or Step 7 inputs respectively.

Question: How does a significant amount of Un-Compensated Owner contribution impact the evaluation and deal score?
Answer: A significant amount of Un-Compensated Owner contribution to the strategic operation of the company will have a negative impact on the evaluation and deal score. The Un-Compensated Owner contribution refers to the time and talent contribution that is not being paid to the owner but is critical to the operation of the company. 
When evaluating a company or deal, it is important to consider the value of this contribution in order to properly assess the real value of the company. If this contribution is excluded, the EBITDA value of the company or deal may simply reflect providing the owner a "job" rather than the true value of the business.
The Un-Compensated Owner contribution input is used as a factor in the evaluation process, specifically in the ThruThink Evaluation. The amount entered for Un-Compensated Owner contribution will not add expense or affect the cash flow projections, but it will be used to calculate the evaluation and deal score. 
It is important to provide a realistic assessment of the Un-Compensated Owner contribution as it is an important component for proper deal evaluation. The evaluation and deal score will be negatively impacted if there is a significant amount of Un-Compensated Owner contribution, as it indicates a potential reliance on the owner's unpaid efforts for the company's success.

Question: Should the input for Un-Compensated Owner Contribution be considered as the return on the Owner's equity?
Answer: No, the input for Un-Compensated Owner Contribution should not be considered as the return on the Owner's equity. The text explicitly states that this input should not be considered as the return on the Owner's equity, which should be reflected in Step 8. The Un-Compensated Owner Contribution is specifically meant to capture the value of the Owner's time and talent contributions that are critical to the operation of the company but are not being paid to the Owner. It is intended to assess the real value of the company or deal by accounting for the Owner's significant contributions that are not reflected in the current level of EBITDA.

Question: When should the Projected EBITDA input be used?
Answer: The Projected EBITDA input should be used when the value of the Owner's contribution to the Operations of the Company is not reflected in the projected EBITDA. This input is specifically for the purposes of the ThruThink Evaluation calculations and will only add an implied expense to the projected EBITDA for the Evaluation calculations. It will not add expense or a cash flow adjustment to the actual projected EBITDA. If there is a need to make actual expense or cash flow adjustments for Owner Compensation, it can be done using the Step 7 Inputs or the Owner Compensation Input page directly.
