Question: What is the purpose of the Initial Asset Write Off provision?
Answer: The purpose of the Initial Asset Write Off provision is to allow the buyer of a company to write off a percentage of the initial asset value that is being paid to the seller. This provision is intended to address any doubts or concerns the buyer may have about the value of the asset at the time of purchase or analysis. By writing off a portion of the beginning value of the asset, the buyer can reflect any confidence issues with the asset without changing the purchase price paid to the seller.
