Question: What happens if there is remaining equity required for a transaction after the equity section is completed?
Answer: If there is remaining equity required for a transaction after the equity section is completed, it means that there has not been enough cash provided through debt funds, cash equity inputs, or cash equity notes to satisfy the cash requirements of the transaction. In the *ThruThink* analysis, this will be indicated as an "Error". The analysis will place the amount of remaining equity required in the equity section of the balance sheet as "Additional Equity Required" without an equity group identification. However, this will still cause an "Error" in the error summary report.
To correct this error, the user can make adjustments in Step 6 by providing more debt funds if possible, decreasing the minimum beginning cash required, increasing the equity cash provided in Step 8, or decreasing the purchase price in Step 4.
If the project is an individual quick deal project, an "Error" will not be caused, and the remaining equity required amount will be automatically placed in the equity section of the balance sheet as "Additional Equity Required" without an equity group identification. However, if any changes are subsequently made by the user to the equity groups that change it from a quick deal, an error will be caused, and the remaining equity required will need to be identified to the individual equity groups.
In summary, if there is remaining equity required after the equity section is completed, adjustments need to be made to the inputs in order to provide more funds or decrease the cash requirements of the transaction.

Question: How can a user correct a remaining equity required error?
Answer: To correct a remaining equity required error, the user has several options:
1. Adjust debt funds: The user can increase the amount of debt funds in Step 6 of the analysis. This means obtaining more financing through loans or other debt instruments to fulfill the remaining equity requirement.
2. Decrease minimum beginning cash: The user can decrease the minimum beginning cash required in Step 8. This means reducing the amount of cash that needs to be available at the start of the project, which can help satisfy the remaining equity requirement.
3. Increase equity cash provided: The user can increase the amount of cash equity provided in Step 8. This means contributing more cash to the project to fulfill the remaining equity requirement.
4. Decrease purchase price: The user can decrease the purchase price in Step 4. This means negotiating a lower price for the transaction, which can reduce the amount of equity required.
It's important to note that these options may have different implications and should be carefully considered based on the specific circumstances of the project.

Question: What happens if the project is an individual quick deal project?
Answer: If the project is an individual quick deal project, there will not be an "Error" indicated in the analysis. However, there may still be a remaining equity required for the transaction. In this case, the remaining equity required will be automatically placed in the equity section of the balance sheet as "Additional Equity Required" without an equity group identification.
If any changes are subsequently made by the user to the equity groups that change it from a quick deal, an error will be caused and the remaining equity required will need to be identified to the individual equity groups.

Question: How can surplus cash be reduced?
Answer: Surplus cash can be reduced in several ways:
1. Reduce cash supplied to the transaction: The amount of cash provided through debt funds or equity contributions can be decreased. This means that less cash will be available, resulting in a reduction of surplus cash.
2. Increase Beginning Cash Working Capital requirement: By increasing the minimum beginning cash required, more cash will be utilized, thereby reducing the surplus cash amount.
3. Adjust equity cash provided: In Step 8 or Step 4, the equity cash provided can be increased. This means that more cash will be allocated towards equity, reducing the surplus cash.
It is important to note that if surplus cash is left as surplus, it will be distributed to the equity groups based on their percentage of ownership indicated in the equity inputs. This distribution will occur during the transaction escrow, after the transaction is completed but before the first year of operations. The distribution will be reflected in the equity section of the beginning balance sheet.

Question: Can a user purchase a partial equity interest in the company?
Answer: Yes, a user can purchase a partial equity interest in the company. This can be done in the Step 8 Equity Input process. However, when purchasing a partial equity interest, Transaction Sheet Debt will not be allowed. The user must provide all of the funds required for the equity purchase as Equity Cash. This is because Transaction Sheet Debt will flow to the post-transaction company after the purchase and if it is used for a partial equity interest, it will dilute the non-purchased equity holders' interest.
When a partial equity interest is purchased, the post-transaction company's Balance Sheet, Income Statement, Cash Flow, and Company performance reports represent 100% of the company. There are also Equity Group reports that provide return analysis on each Equity Group's performance.
If a partial equity interest is being purchased, the acquiring equity holders may provide Equity Debt, but only in the same amount that Working Capital Cash is being provided by the transaction. This ensures that the non-purchased equity holders' interest will be kept intact because cash is increased by the same amount as the Equity Debt.
In the case where a partial interest purchase is made and the user selects "Yes" in Step 8 for "Does Contributed Cash Stay in the Company," the cash is paid out to the Selling Equity Group. Both the Selling Equity Group and the Purchasing Equity Group then re-contribute an amount of cash in proportion to their separate Equity Ownership shares to keep the Equity Groups balanced. It is important to note that this feature will require additional cash to be contributed by the purchasing Equity Groups.

Question: Why is transaction sheet debt not allowed when purchasing a partial equity interest?
Answer: Transaction sheet debt is not allowed when purchasing a partial equity interest because it would dilute the non-purchased equity holders' interest in the company. When transaction sheet debt is used, it flows to the post-transaction company after the purchase, and if it is used for a partial equity interest, it would reduce the ownership percentage of the non-purchased equity holders. To maintain the integrity of the equity ownership structure, all funds required for the equity purchase must be provided as equity cash.

Question: What reports provide return analysis on each equity group's performance?
Answer: The reports that provide return analysis on each equity group's performance are the Equity Group reports. These reports analyze the performance of each equity group and provide insights into their returns.

Question: Can equity debt be provided when purchasing a partial equity interest?
Answer: No, equity debt cannot be provided when purchasing a partial equity interest. The text states that when a partial interest equity purchase is being made, transaction sheet debt will not be allowed. The user must provide all of the funds required for the equity purchase as equity cash. This is because transaction sheet debt will flow to the post-transaction company after the purchase and if it is used for a partial equity interest, it will dilute the non-purchased equity holders' interest.

Question: What happens if the user selects "Yes" for "Does Contributed Cash Stay in the Company" in Step 8?
Answer: If the user selects "Yes" for "Does Contributed Cash Stay in the Company" in Step 8, it means that the cash contributed by the equity holders will not be distributed to them immediately. Instead, the cash will be paid out to the selling equity group, and both the selling equity group and the purchasing equity group will re-contribute an amount of cash in proportion to their separate equity ownership shares.
This feature is designed to keep the equity groups balanced. By re-contributing cash, the purchasing equity groups ensure that the equity ownership shares remain proportional and that the non-purchased equity holders' interests are not diluted. However, it is important to note that selecting "Yes" for this option will require additional cash to be contributed by the purchasing equity groups.
