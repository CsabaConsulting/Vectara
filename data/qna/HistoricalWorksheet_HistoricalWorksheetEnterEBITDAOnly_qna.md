Question: Why is it important to enter historic sales in the Sales Section?
Answer: It is important to enter historic sales in the Sales Section because the *ThruThink Evaluation* relies on historical sales data for its analysis. By entering the sales data, the evaluation can provide a more accurate assessment of the business's performance and financial health. If historic sales are not entered, the evaluation may be less accurate and may not provide a comprehensive understanding of the business's profitability. Therefore, entering historic sales ensures that the evaluation takes into account the full picture of the business's financial performance.

Question: How can the user ensure that the EBITDA reflects only the EBITDA input?
Answer: To ensure that the EBITDA reflects only the EBITDA input, the user can follow the instructions provided in the Historical Worksheet. The user should enter the EBITDA amount in the 'Add back' section of the page as an add back adjustment. This means that the user should not enter the income and expenses separately.
However, it is important to note that the *ThruThink Evaluation* relies on historical sales in its analysis. If the user enters only the EBITDA without including sales, the evaluation may be less accurate. To address this, the user has the option to enter historic sales in the Sales Section of the page. To ensure that the EBITDA reflects only the EBITDA input, the user should reverse out the same sales total by entering a negative amount for the sales total in the EBITDA 'Add back' section of the page.
By following these steps, the user can ensure that the EBITDA reflects only the EBITDA input while still considering the impact of historic sales on the accuracy of the evaluation.
