Question: What is the purpose of the Historical Worksheet?
Answer: The purpose of the Historical Worksheet is to allow the user to input historical performance data in a format that is requested by the ThruThink analysis. It assists the user in making sound projections based on historical performance. The Historical Worksheet is a stand-alone analysis tool that does not affect the calculations in the ThruThink analysis. It provides calculation results that are examples of the results requested in the Sales/EBITDA Input page and the Accounts Payable Future Terms Set-Up page of the ThruThink analysis. These numbers can be helpful in guiding the inputs requested in those forms. Additionally, the user has the option to use the projections from the Historical Worksheet for the projections in the Cash Flow Control page, which are the projections used in the ThruThink analysis. There is an input option available on the Historical Worksheet Input page to incorporate the Worksheet projections into the ThruThink analysis. However, it is important to note that using the Worksheet projections will replace any manual override inputs made by the user in the Cash Flow Control to Sales Override and the COGS Percent of Sales Override. These original override inputs will be lost and cannot be restored by pressing the Clear button.

Question: How does the Historical Worksheet affect the calculations in the ThruThink analysis?
Answer: The Historical Worksheet is a stand-alone tool that allows users to input historical performance data in the same format as requested by the ThruThink analysis. It assists users in making sound projections based on historical performance. However, it is important to note that the Historical Worksheet does not directly affect the calculations in the ThruThink analysis.
The Historical Worksheet provides several calculation results that serve as examples of the results requested in the Sales/EBITDA Input page and the Accounts Payable Future Terms Set-Up page of the ThruThink analysis. These numbers can be helpful in guiding users when inputting data in those forms.
Although the Historical Worksheet is separate from the ThruThink analysis, users have the option to use the projections from the Worksheet for the projections in the Cash Flow Control page, which are the projections used in the ThruThink analysis. There is an input option available on the lower portion of the Historical Worksheet Input page that allows users to incorporate the Worksheet projections into the ThruThink analysis.
When using the Worksheet projections in the Cash Flow Control page, certain adjustments will be made. The Company sales total will be adjusted in the Sales Override Inputs, the Company COGS % of Sales will be adjusted in the COGS Percent of Sales Override Inputs, and the Company Operating Expense projections total will be entered into the Cash Flow Operating Expense Input page. These adjustments will be reflected on the Cash Flow Control page under Adjustments to Operating Expense.
It is important to note that using the Worksheet projections in the Cash Flow Control page will replace any manual override inputs made by the user for Sales Override and COGS Percent of Sales Override. These original user inputs will be lost and cannot be restored by pressing the Clear button. However, these adjustments will only affect the manual user inputs for Sales Override and COGS Percent of Sales Override on the Cash Flow Control page and will not affect any Step 3 user inputs.
