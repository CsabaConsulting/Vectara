Question: What are the two methods of calculating taxes?
Answer: The given text explains that there are two methods of calculating taxes: the Accrual Basis and the Cash Basis. 
1. Accrual Basis: Under the Accrual Basis method, taxable net income is calculated using income and expenses when they are incurred, regardless of whether the income has been received or the expense has been paid in the same period. This means that income and expenses are recognized when they are earned or incurred, regardless of when the actual cash is received or paid.
2. Cash Basis: On the other hand, the Cash Basis method calculates taxable income using income and expenses that are received or paid during the applicable term. This means that income is recognized when it is received, and expenses are recognized when they are paid.
It is important to note that the tax calculations provided by the system are projections and are approximate. They do not adhere to GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) or any specific accounting procedure or tax code. Additionally, when using the Cash Basis method, cash paid for inventory is not counted as an expense for income tax purposes.

Question: How is taxable income calculated under the Cash Basis method?
Answer: Under the Cash Basis method, taxable income is calculated based on income and expenses that are received or paid during the applicable term. This means that only income that has been received and expenses that have been paid within a specific period are considered for tax calculation. 
Regarding inventory, cash paid to create inventory or capitalized expenses are treated as an Inventory Asset and not counted as an expense for income tax purposes. This means that when using the Cash Basis method, cash paid for inventory will not be considered as an expense for income tax calculation.
It is important to note that even if the Cash Basis method is selected to calculate income taxes, the Income Statement will still be prepared on an accrual basis, with accrual-based taxes shown as an expense. However, the cash flow will reflect the Cash Basis tax payments. 
If there is a difference between the taxes calculated under the Accrual Basis and the Cash Basis methods, this difference will be shown on the Balance Sheet as a Deferred Liability. If the Cash Basis taxes are lower than the Accrual Basis taxes, it will be shown as a Deferred Liability. Conversely, if the Cash Basis taxes are higher than the Accrual Basis taxes, it will be shown as a negative Deferred Liability.

Question: How is cash paid for inventory treated in both the Accrual and Cash Basis methods?
Answer: In both the Accrual and Cash Basis methods, cash paid for inventory is treated as an Inventory Asset and not counted as an Expense for income tax purposes. This means that when calculating taxable net income, the cash paid to create inventory or capitalized expenses are not considered as expenses. 
In the Accrual Basis method, taxable net income is calculated using income and expenses when they are incurred, regardless of whether the income has been received or the expense has been paid in the same period. Therefore, cash paid for inventory is not immediately deducted as an expense for tax purposes.
In the Cash Basis method, taxable income is calculated using income and expenses received or paid during the applicable term. Even in this method, cash paid for inventory is not counted as an expense for income tax purposes.
It's important to note that if the user selects the Cash Basis to calculate income taxes, the Income Statement will still be on an accrual basis with accrual-based taxes as an expense. However, the cash flow will reflect the Cash Basis tax payments. Any difference between the Accrual Basis taxes and the Cash Basis taxes will be shown on the Balance Sheet as a Deferred Liability when Cash Basis taxes are less than Accrual Basis taxes or as a negative Deferred Liability when Cash Basis taxes are higher than Accrual Basis taxes.

Question: If the User selects Cash Basis for calculating income taxes, will the Income Statement still be on an accrual basis?
Answer: Yes, if the User selects Cash Basis for calculating income taxes, the Income Statement will still be on an accrual basis. This means that income and expenses will be recorded when they are incurred, regardless of whether the income has been received or the expense has been paid in that same period. The accrual based taxes will be reflected as an expense on the Income Statement. However, the cash flow will reflect the Cash Basis tax payments, which means that the actual cash received or paid during the applicable term will be used to calculate taxable income.

Question: How will the cash flow reflect the tax payments if Cash Basis is selected?
Answer: If the user selects the Cash Basis to calculate income taxes, the cash flow will reflect the Cash Basis tax payments. This means that the tax payments will be based on the actual cash received or paid during the applicable term. The Income Statement, however, will still be on an accrual basis with accrual-based taxes as an expense. 
Any difference between the Accrual Basis taxes and the Cash Basis taxes will be shown on the Balance Sheet as a Deferred Liability. If the Cash Basis taxes are less than the Accrual Basis taxes, the difference will be shown as a Deferred Liability. On the other hand, if the Cash Basis taxes are higher than the Accrual Basis taxes, the difference will be shown as a negative Deferred Liability. 
In summary, when the Cash Basis is selected, the tax payments will be based on actual cash flow, while the Income Statement will still be on an accrual basis. Any difference between the Accrual Basis and Cash Basis taxes will be reflected as a Deferred Liability on the Balance Sheet.

On the other hand, if the Cash Basis taxes are higher than the Accrual Basis taxes, the difference will be shown as a negative Deferred Liability.

Question: How is the difference shown on the Balance Sheet when Cash Basis taxes are higher than Accrual Basis taxes?
