Question: What are the three choices for the "Show On" selection?
Answer: The three choices for the "Show On" selection are:
1. Transaction Sheet: Choosing this option will send the individual item to the Transaction Sheet, where it can be used in various transactions such as purchasing the target company, purchasing the existing company, or the existing company purchasing the target company.
2. Existing Company: Choosing this option will send the individual item to the Existing Company Input Section, where it will be included in the beginning existing company balance sheet. If the item is sent to the Transaction Sheet when purchasing the existing company, it will be an additional asset in addition to the existing company, and it will be added to the existing company asset after the effective date.
3. Existing Company Sheet-Adjustment: Choosing this option will send the individual item to the Existing Company Input Section, but it will be placed in the Adjustment Column next to the beginning existing company inputs. This option allows the user to add asset items to the existing company in order to "restructure" the beginning existing company asset structure. This is useful when an existing company asset needs to be used with a new structure according to a restructure plan. The restructure happens before the effective date, and the future years will reflect the results of the new restructure.

Question: What does it mean to choose "Transaction Sheet" for the "Show On" selection?
Answer: Choosing "Transaction Sheet" for the "Show On" selection means that the individual item, such as a note or security receivable, will be sent to the Transaction Sheet. The Transaction Sheet is a section where the item can be used in various transactions, such as purchasing a target company, purchasing an existing company, or the existing company purchasing the target company. By selecting "Transaction Sheet," the item will be included in the transaction and used according to the specific transaction being performed.

Question: What happens when an asset is sent to the Transaction Sheet when purchasing the Existing Company?
Answer: When an asset is sent to the Transaction Sheet during the purchase of the Existing Company, it will be treated as an additional asset in addition to the Existing Company. The asset will be added to the Existing Company's asset after the Effective Date. This means that the asset will be included in the Beginning Existing Company Balance Sheet and will be used in accordance with the transaction being performed, such as "Purchase the Target Company", "Purchase the Existing Company", or "The Existing Company Purchases the Target Company".
---
Question: What is the purpose of choosing "Existing Company-Adjustment" for the "Show On" selection?
Answer: The purpose of choosing "Existing Company-Adjustment" for the "Show On" selection is to send the individual item to the Existing Company Input Section but place it into the Adjustment Column next to the Beginning Existing Company Inputs. This allows the user to add asset items to the Existing Company in order to "restructure" the Beginning Existing Company asset structure. This feature becomes useful when an existing Company Asset needs to be used with a new structure in accordance with a restructure plan. By selecting "Existing Company-Adjustment", the restructure can be implemented before the Effective Date, and the future years will reflect the results of the new restructure.

Question: What does "Year of Funding" indicate?
Answer: The "Year of Funding" indicates the year in which a loan is funded. It is used to determine the timing of loan funding for monthly cash flow purposes. For the beginning effective date, it can be left blank or a '0' can be entered. If a '1' is entered, it indicates that the loan is funded during Year 1, and so on. The funding month can also be specified to indicate the specific month during the indicated years in which the loan is funded. If no month is indicated, the loan will be funded in month 12 by default.
---
Question: What happens if the "Year of Funding" is left blank for the Beginning Effective Date?
Answer: If the "Year of Funding" is left blank for the Beginning Effective Date, it means that the loan is not funded during the first year. In other words, there is no initial funding for the loan at the beginning of the Effective Date. This could indicate that the loan is funded at a later date or that there is no loan funding at all.
---
Question: Can the User identify the month in which the loan is funded?
Answer: Yes, the User can identify the month in which the loan is funded. If the loan is funded during Years 1-3, the User may specify the month during those years in which the loan is funded. If no month is indicated, the loan will be funded in month 12 by default.

---
Question: What happens if the payment over the indicated periods is not enough to pay off principal and interest?
Answer: If the payment over the indicated periods is not enough to pay off the principal and interest, the remaining balance owed will be paid off in the last payment period. This means that for amortized payment options, if the payment amount is not sufficient to cover both principal and interest, the remaining balance will be paid off in the final payment. For level principal plus interest payment options, if no principal payment amount is inserted, only the interest will be calculated and paid.
---
Question: What happens if no payment amount is inserted for the amortized payment option?
Answer: If no payment amount is inserted for the amortized payment option, an automatic calculation based on the factors given will be used. This means that the system will calculate the payment amount required to pay off both the principal and interest over the term of the loan. The calculated payment amount will be used for the amortized payment option.
---
Question: What happens if no principal payment amount is inserted for the Level Principal plus Interest option?
Answer: If no principal payment amount is inserted for the Level Principal plus Interest option, the calculation will default to interest only. This means that the payment will only cover the interest amount and no principal will be paid off.

Question: What does the "Month Payment is Due" entry apply to?
Answer: The "Month Payment is Due" entry applies to a Note or Securities Receivable with annual payments (1 per year). For items other than annual payments, the default value for the Month Due will be month "12". 
The Month the payment is due to be received is determined by the Month # from the Effective Date. For example, if the Effective Date is March 31 and the payment is due in June, then the Month Period Due would be 3. 
If the Month Due is prior to month 12, the total payment will stay the same, but the amount of interest income will vary and represent only the months of the year prior to and including the Month Due period. The balance of the payment will be principal and reduce the note receivable amount accordingly.
If this is a prior existing note receivable, for annual payments only, input a Month Due greater than 12. The Start Month is the month the payment was last received last year plus 12. The interest received will be for the 12 months after last year's payment, which will include the periods from the prior year. On an accrual basis, interest paid this year for the months of last year will be reversed out of Accrued Interest Income Asset and accrued Interest Income. 
An automatic accrual entry will be made debiting Accrued Interest Income Asset and crediting Interest Income for the months after the Month Period Due for each Year beginning with Year 1. This input is then automatically reversed the following year.

Question: What is the default month due for items other than annual payments?
Answer: For items other than annual payments, the default month due is month "12".
---
Question: How is the Month Period Due calculated for an annual payment?
Answer: For an annual payment, the Month Period Due is calculated based on the Effective Date and the month in which the payment is due to be received. 
If the Effective Date is, for example, March 31 and the payment is due in June, then the Month Period Due would be 3. 
If the Month Due is prior to month 12, the total payment will stay the same, but the amount of interest income will vary and represent only the months of the year prior to and including the Month Due period. The balance of the payment will be principal and reduce the note receivable amount accordingly.
If this is a prior existing note receivable, for annual payments only, input a Month Due greater than 12. The Start Month is the month the payment was last received last year plus 12. The interest received will be for the 12 months after last year's payment, which will include the periods from the prior year. On an accrual basis, interest paid this year for the months of last year will be reversed out of Accrued Interest Income Asset and accrued Interest Income. 
For example, if there is a payment for an existing note receivable due in April (Month 4) this year and was last received in April of last year, use a Month Due of 16 (April = Month 4, 4 + 12 months back = 16). 12 months of interest will be received and become Interest Income, and 8/12 of the interest received will be reversed out or credited to Accrued Interest Income Asset and lower or debit Interest Income.
An automatic accrual entry will be made debiting Accrued Interest Income Asset and crediting Interest Income for the months after the Month Period Due for each year beginning with Year 1. This input is then automatically reversed the following year.

Question: What happens if the Month Due is prior to month 12?
Answer: If the Month Due is prior to month 12, the total payment will remain the same, but the amount of interest income will vary and represent only the months of the year prior to and including the Month Due period. The remaining balance of the payment will be considered as principal and will reduce the note receivable amount accordingly. 
For example, if the Effective Date is March 31 and the payment is due in June, then the Month Period Due would be 3. In this case, the interest income generated will only cover the months from March to June. The remaining portion of the payment will be considered as principal and will be used to reduce the note receivable amount.
It is important to note that for prior existing note receivables with annual payments, if the Month Due is greater than 12, the Start Month is the month the payment was last received last year plus 12. The interest received will be for the 12 months after last year's payment, which will include the periods from the prior year. On an accrual basis, interest paid this year for the months of last year will be reversed out of Accrued Interest Income Asset and accrued Interest Income.

Question: What should be entered as an initial balance input for a prior existing note receivable?
Answer: For a prior existing note receivable, the initial balance input should be entered as an Accrued Interest Income Receivable asset as of the beginning date in the Asset set up process. This represents the months of the year after the last payment was received in the prior year.
---
Question: How should the Month Due be entered for a prior existing note receivable with annual payments?
Answer: For a prior existing note receivable with annual payments, the Month Due should be entered as a value greater than 12. The Start Month is the month in which the payment was last received in the prior year plus 12. 
For example, if there is a payment for an existing note receivable due in April (Month 4) this year and it was last received in April of last year, the Month Due should be entered as 16 (April = Month 4, 4 + 12 months back = 16). 
By entering the Month Due as a value greater than 12, the interest received will be for the 12 months after the last year's payment, which includes the periods from the prior year. On an accrual basis, the interest paid this year for the months of last year will be reversed out of the Accrued Interest Income Asset and accrued Interest Income. 
An automatic accrual entry will be made, debiting the Accrued Interest Income Asset and crediting Interest Income for the months after the Month Period Due for each year beginning with Year 1. This input is then automatically reversed the following year.
---
Question: What happens if the Month Due is greater than 12 for a prior existing note receivable with annual payments?
Answer: If the Month Due is greater than 12 for a prior existing note receivable with annual payments, the Start Month is the month the payment was last received last year plus 12. The interest received will be for the 12 months after last year's payment, which will include the periods from the prior year. 
On an accrual basis, interest paid this year for the months of last year will be reversed out of Accrued Interest Income Asset and accrued Interest Income. For example, if there is a payment for an existing note receivable due in April (Month 4) this year and was last received in April of last year, use a month due of 16 (April = Month 4, 4 + 12 months back = 16). 
12 months of interest will be received and become Interest Income, and 8/12 of the interest received will be reversed out or credited to Accrued Interest Income Asset and lower or debit Interest Income. 
An automatic accrual entry will be made debiting Accrued Interest Income Asset and crediting Interest Income for the months after the Month Period Due for each year beginning with Year 1. This input is then automatically reversed the following year. 
Please refer to the Interest Income information page for the details of these entries.

Question: What automatic accrual entries are made for the months after the Month Period Due?
Answer: For the months after the Month Period Due, an automatic accrual entry is made. This entry debits the Accrued Interest Income Asset and credits the Interest Income. This accrual entry is made for each year beginning with Year 1. 
It is important to note that this accrual entry is automatically reversed the following year.
