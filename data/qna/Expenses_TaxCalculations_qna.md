Question: What is the purpose of the Tax Rate Schedule?
Answer: The purpose of the Tax Rate Schedule is to provide a convenient reference for the user to estimate their income tax expenses. It contains generalized tax rates that can be adjusted by the user to reflect the specific tax rates applicable to their country, state, or region. The Tax Rate Schedule is used in conjunction with user inputs to calculate income tax expenses in the Income Statement and the Liability for Income Taxes Due in the Balance Sheet. It is important to note that the tax calculations in this analysis are not intended to reflect actual tax computations based on any tax code, but rather to provide a general indication or estimate of tax expenses. For a more specific estimate of tax expenses or liabilities, it is recommended to consult a tax specialist who can consider the appropriate tax code for the individual situation.

Question: How are Income Tax Expense and Liability for Income Taxes Due calculated?
Answer: Income Tax Expense in the Income Statement and the Liability for the Income Taxes Due in the Balance Sheet are calculated on the Accrual Basis. The User may choose to pay taxes on a Cash Basis and the cash tax payments will be calculated and paid accordingly. The Cash Flow Control will reflect the Taxes paid.
The income tax calculations in this analysis are not intended to reflect actual tax computations based on any tax code. They are intended to give only a very general indication or estimate of tax expense using the rates indicated on the Tax Rate page as applied to basic unadjusted net gains from a sale or net income from operations as defined in this analysis. A tax specialist should be consulted using the appropriate tax code for a more specific estimate of the tax expense or liability on any individual situation.
For each type of tax, the Tax Rate Input page allows for up to seven graduated taxable income levels. For simplicity, the default is just one tax level for all taxable net income. The User may adjust accordingly.
The *ThruThink* analysis will apply the rates shown in the Tax Rate Input page to the Taxable Net Income calculated by the analysis for the future years. The Taxable Net Income is a basic generalized assessment of Taxable Net Income using EBITDA less Interest paid less the Tax basis depreciation and amortization expense as set up in the ThruThink analysis by the User.
The actual tax calculated for any given year (Taxable Year) will be expensed in the Taxable Year.
For Cash Flow purposes, there are estimated tax payments paid during the Taxable Year on a quarterly basis in Period 4, 6, 9 and 12 of the Taxable Year. Actual taxes are then calculated for the Taxable Year and paid in Period 4 of the following year with a credit taken for the estimated payments paid during the Taxable Year.
At the end of the Taxable Year, there will be an Income Tax Liability for the difference between the Taxes Owed and the estimated tax payments made during the Taxable Year.
With *ThruThink*, there is a provision to apply Net Operating Losses (NOL) from previous years to the Taxable Income of the Taxable Year. Please see separate Help Topic for Net Operating Loss carry forward.

Question: What is the Income Tax Liability at the end of the Taxable Year based on?
Answer: The Income Tax Liability at the end of the Taxable Year is based on the difference between the Taxes Owed and the estimated tax payments made during the Taxable Year. This means that if the estimated tax payments made during the year are less than the actual taxes owed, there will be a remaining tax liability at the end of the year. Conversely, if the estimated tax payments exceed the actual taxes owed, there may be a tax refund. It is important to note that the provided text does not specify how the Taxes Owed are calculated, as it states that the income tax calculations in this analysis are not intended to reflect actual tax computations based on any tax code. Therefore, for a more specific estimate of the tax expense or liability, it is recommended to consult a tax specialist using the appropriate tax code for the given situation.

Question: Is there a provision to apply Net Operating Losses from previous years to the Taxable Income of the Taxable Year?
Answer: Yes, there is a provision in *ThruThink* to apply Net Operating Losses (NOL) from previous years to the Taxable Income of the Taxable Year. This means that if a company has incurred losses in previous years, those losses can be used to offset the taxable income in the current year. This provision allows for the carry forward of Net Operating Losses, which can help reduce the tax liability in the current year. For more detailed information on how to apply Net Operating Losses, please refer to the separate Help Topic provided in the documentation.
