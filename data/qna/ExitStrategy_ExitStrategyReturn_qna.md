Question: What are the two ways in which the Market Value of the Company can be expressed?
Answer: The Market Value of the Company can be expressed in two ways: as a multiple of EBITDA or as a flat amount.

Question: What is the advantage of using the EBITDA Multiple method of valuation?
Answer: The advantage of using the EBITDA Multiple method of valuation is that it provides a relatively simple measure of value on an ongoing basis as it automatically reflects the performance of the company. This means that as the company's EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization) increases or decreases, the market value of the company will also adjust accordingly. This method allows for a more dynamic and responsive valuation of the company's worth, making it easier to track and evaluate its financial performance over time. Additionally, using the EBITDA Multiple method can provide a consistent and standardized approach to valuing the company, making it easier to compare with industry benchmarks or similar businesses.

Question: For Horizon time periods over 10 years, what should the User enter for Year 10?
Answer: For Horizon time periods over 10 years, the User should enter an appropriate Exit Value for Year 10. This is important because the *ThruThink Evaluation* only evaluates the first 10 years of a deal. If there is no Market Value available, the evaluation will use the Hard Asset liquidation value for the Exit Value at year 10. Therefore, it is recommended to enter a suitable Exit Value for Year 10 as well as the end of the Horizon time period.
