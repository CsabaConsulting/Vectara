Question: What is the purpose of the Individually Scheduled Accounts Receivable Debt Input?
Answer: The purpose of the Individually Scheduled Accounts Receivable Debt Input is to consolidate multiple individual loans into one Line of Credit at each location. This input allows the user to list and track the details of each individual loan, such as the loan amount, interest rate, and eligibility percentage. However, after the Effective Date, these individual loans will be rolled into one Line of Credit. The inclusion of separate individual loans in the input is only intended to provide the user with a detailed view of the consolidation process. The separate Loan to Value and Ineligible Inputs are provided for informational purposes to calculate weighted averages and guide the inputs for the future line of credit.
