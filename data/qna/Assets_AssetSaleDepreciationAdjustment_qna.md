Question: What happens to the regular depreciation expense after an asset sale?
Answer: After an asset sale, the regular depreciation expense will continue but be reduced by an allocated amount representing the sold asset. The sale amount will be divided by an estimate for the remaining life for assets in that asset class, which will reduce the annual depreciation expense amount for the asset class. This adjustment is only an estimate and not based on the specific asset removal, as the exact year of original acquisition of the sold asset is unknown. An adjusting journal entry may be made to accumulated depreciation, depreciation expense, and gain/loss on sale to make more specific adjustments.

Question: How is the annual depreciation expense amount for the Asset Class reduced?
Answer: The annual depreciation expense amount for the Asset Class is reduced by dividing the Sale Amount of the sold asset by an estimate for the remaining life of assets in that Asset Class. This reduction is made to account for the fact that the sold asset is no longer part of the Asset Class and therefore should not be included in the calculation of annual depreciation expense. However, it is important to note that this adjustment is only an estimate and not based on the specific removal of the sold asset, as the exact year of its original acquisition is unknown.

Question: Is the depreciation adjustment based on the specific asset removal?
Answer: No, the depreciation adjustment is not based on the specific asset removal. The exact year of original acquisition of the sold asset is unknown, so the adjustment is made by dividing the sale amount by an estimate for the remaining life for assets in that asset class. This estimate is used to reduce the annual depreciation expense amount for the asset class as a whole, rather than making specific adjustments for individual assets.

Question: What accounts may be adjusted through an Adjusting Journal Entry?
Answer: Through an Adjusting Journal Entry, the accounts that may be adjusted include Accumulated Depreciation, Depreciation Expense, and Gain/Loss on Sale. These adjustments are made to account for the impact of an asset sale on the depreciation expense and the overall financial statements. The adjustment is an estimate and is not based on the specific removal of the sold asset, as the exact year of acquisition of the sold asset is unknown. The allocated amount representing the sold asset is divided by an estimate for the remaining life of assets in that asset class, which reduces the annual depreciation expense for the asset class. The Adjusting Journal Entry helps to make more specific adjustments to these accounts to accurately reflect the impact of the asset sale on the financial statements.

Question: What is the purpose of the depreciation adjustment?
Answer: The purpose of the depreciation adjustment is to account for the impact of an asset sale on the regular depreciation expense. After an asset is sold, the annual depreciation expense for the remaining assets in the same asset class (e.g., Machinery & Equipment) is reduced by an allocated amount representing the sold asset. This adjustment is made to reflect the fact that the sold asset is no longer part of the asset class and should not be included in the calculation of depreciation expense. The adjustment is an estimate based on dividing the sale amount by an estimate for the remaining life of assets in that asset class. It is important to note that this adjustment is only an estimate and not based on the specific removal of the sold asset, as the exact year of acquisition of the sold asset is unknown. In some cases, an adjusting journal entry may be made to more specifically adjust the accumulated depreciation, depreciation expense, and gain/loss on the sale.
