Question: What is the purpose of using an Equity Note?
Answer: The purpose of using an Equity Note is to provide a means for an Equity Group to contribute cash to satisfy the remaining Cash Requirement in a closing escrow. When the amount of cash contributed by an Equity Group is greater than that required by their Ownership Percentage, the excess cash can be contributed as an Equity Note. This Equity Note will become a loan to the Company and can be at zero interest or any other desired interest rate. By using an Equity Note, the financial Equity split of the total Company can be kept consistent with the Equity Percent Ownership of the Equity Groups. This allows for a more accurate distribution of ownership and ensures that equity contributions from one Equity Group are not attributed to another Equity Group.

Question: How does changing the amount of the Equity Note affect the Cash Requirement to close the escrow?
Answer: Changing the amount of the Equity Note will cause the Cash Requirement to close the escrow to go up or down based on the amount of the % Points Fee change. When using the Equity Note to provide the final amount of the Cash Requirement, increasing the Equity Note will also increase the Cash Requirement due to the % Points Fee. This creates a never-ending chase to provide the remaining Cash Requirement, although the increase in the Cash Requirement will become smaller with each round of increasing the Equity Note amount. To satisfy the Remaining Cash Requirement, one option is to use a direct Cash Contribution. Alternatively, multiple rounds of increasing the Equity Note amount can be made until the Remaining Cash Requirement becomes small enough to be covered by a direct Cash Contribution.

Question: What are the options for satisfying the Remaining Cash Requirement?
Answer: There are two options for satisfying the Remaining Cash Requirement. 
The first option is to use a direct Cash Contribution to fulfill the remaining cash requirement. This means that the required amount of cash can be contributed directly to meet the remaining cash requirement.
The second option is to make multiple rounds of increasing the Equity Note amount to satisfy the Remaining Cash Requirement. In this option, the Equity Note amount is increased multiple times until the Remaining Cash Requirement becomes small enough to be covered by a direct Cash Contribution. The Equity Note is essentially a loan to the company and can be provided at zero interest or at an interest rate as desired.
It is important to note that when using the Equity Note to provide the final amount of the Cash Requirement, the Cash Requirement will increase as the Equity Note amount increases due to the % Points Fee. This can create a never-ending chase to provide the remaining Cash Requirement, although the increase in the Cash Requirement will become smaller with each round of increasing the Equity Note amount.

Question: When can Equity Notes be used?
Answer: Equity Notes can be used when the amount of cash contributed by an Equity Group is greater than that required by the Equity Group's Ownership Percentage. In other words, if the equity contributions by the Equity members are not made in the same percentage split as the ownership percent, equity contributions from one Equity Group will end up being attributed to another Equity Group. In order to keep the financial Equity split consistent with the Equity Percent Ownerships, the cash amounts contributed by the Equity Groups that are over their ownership equity percentages can be contributed as an Equity Note. The Equity Note will then become a loan to the Company and can be at zero interest or other interest rate as desired. This allows the Equity split of the total Company to be kept consistent with the Equity Percent Ownership of the Equity Groups.

Question: How should cash Equity contributions be made by each Equity Group?
Answer: Cash Equity contributions by each Equity Group should be made in the same percentage as the Equity Group's percent ownership. In the *ThruThink* analysis, each Equity Group will be attributed its ownership of the total Company based on the Equity Percent ownership of the Equity Group. It is important to ensure that the equity contributions by the Equity members are made in the same percentage split as the ownership percent. If the contributions are not made in the same percentage split, equity contributions from one Equity Group may end up being attributed to another Equity Group. To maintain consistency between the financial Equity split and the Equity Percent Ownerships, any cash amounts contributed by the Equity Groups that exceed their ownership equity percentages can be contributed as an Equity Note. This Equity Note will become a loan to the Company and can be at zero interest or any other interest rate as desired. By using Equity Notes, the Equity split of the total Company can be kept consistent with the Equity Percent Ownership of the Equity Groups.

Question: What happens if equity contributions are not made in the same percentage split as the ownership percent?
Answer: If equity contributions are not made in the same percentage split as the ownership percent, there can be a discrepancy in the financial equity split of the total company. In this situation, the cash amounts contributed by equity groups that exceed their ownership equity percentages can be contributed as an Equity Note. An Equity Note is essentially a loan to the company and can be provided at zero interest or at an agreed-upon interest rate. By using an Equity Note, the equity split of the total company can be kept consistent with the equity percent ownership of the equity groups. This ensures that the financial equity distribution aligns with the ownership percentages of the equity groups.

Question: How can the financial Equity split be kept consistent with the Equity Percent Ownerships in this circumstance?
Answer: In this circumstance, where the cash contributions by the Equity members are not made in the same percentage split as the ownership percent, the financial Equity split can be kept consistent with the Equity Percent Ownerships by using Equity Notes. 
Equity Notes can be used when the amount of cash contributed by an Equity Group is greater than that required by the Equity Group's Ownership Percentage.
