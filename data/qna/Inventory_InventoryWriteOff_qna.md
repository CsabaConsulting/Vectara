Question: What is the purpose of an inventory write off?
Answer: The purpose of an inventory write off is to remove a certain amount of inventory that has become unusable. This could be due to various reasons such as damage, obsolescence, or expiration. By writing off the inventory, it is no longer considered as part of the available stock and is removed from the company's records. This helps to accurately reflect the true value of the inventory and prevent misleading information about the company's assets. Additionally, the write off reduces the inventory value and increases the expense at the end of the year, which can have an impact on the company's financial statements and profitability.

Question: How does the write off amount affect the inventory and expense?
Answer: The write off amount affects both the inventory and expense. When a certain amount of inventory becomes unusable and needs to be removed, the write off amount is used to reduce the inventory. This means that the quantity of inventory will be decreased by the write off amount. 
Additionally, the write off amount also increases the expense. At the end of the year when the write off occurs, the expense is increased by the write off amount. This is because the write off is considered as a loss or cost incurred by the business due to the unusable inventory. 
Overall, the write off amount has a dual impact on the inventory and expense. It reduces the inventory quantity and increases the expense amount.
