Question: What does the Balance Sheet represent?
Answer: The Balance Sheet represents the post Effective Date or Post Closing Balance Sheet of a transaction. It reflects the financial position of a company at a specific point in time, typically after the closing of a transaction. The Balance Sheet is presented on the Accrual Basis, which means it includes all assets, liabilities, and equity of the company. 
For the purchase or analysis of an Existing Company, the Existing Company's Balance Sheet is entered into the Existing Company Beginning Balance Sheet. This includes the assets and debts of the Existing Company. 
In the case of purchasing a Target Company, the Balance Sheet will reflect the post-closing Balance Sheet of the Target Company after being acquired. It will include the amortized Transaction Expenses, Goodwill of the purchase, and any asset write-offs, adjustments, or restructures from the Existing Company Beginning Balance Sheet. 
If the Existing Company purchases the Target Company, the post-closing Balance Sheet will combine the Target Company acquisition and the Existing Company Beginning Balance Sheet. It will also include the amortized Transaction Expenses, Goodwill of the purchase, and any asset write-offs, adjustments, or restructures from the Existing Company Beginning Balance Sheet. 
If cash is required from the Existing Company to purchase the Target Company, it will be deducted from the Existing Company's Beginning Balance Sheet cash. If there is insufficient cash in the Existing Company to complete the transaction, an error will be shown on the Equity Input Page.
