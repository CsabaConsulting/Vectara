Question: How is Working Capital defined?
Answer: Working Capital is defined as the difference between Assets that will be collected in cash over the next 12 months and Liabilities or debts that will need to be paid in the next 12 months. It includes the Current Portion of Long Term Debt, which refers to the portion of long-term debt that will be due in payments over the next 12 months.

Question: What does the Working Capital Projection to Actual Comparison provide?
Answer: The Working Capital Projection to Actual Comparison provides a general picture of what caused Working Capital to change from the beginning of the year to the period entered on the Projection to Actual Comparison Page. It incorporates the major factors that will affect the Working Capital. This comparison helps analyze the changes in Working Capital over time and provides insights into the financial health and liquidity of a company.

Question: What caution should be taken when comparing item balances for Working Capital?
Answer: When comparing item balances for Working Capital, it is important to exercise caution and ensure that the balances are taken from a full integrated Balance Sheet and Income Statement for accurate comparison purposes. 
One specific caution to consider is the inclusion of non-cash expenses, such as Depreciation, in the Net Income. Depreciation is a non-cash expense that should not affect Working Capital. Therefore, when using Net Income that includes Depreciation to explain the change in Working Capital, it is crucial to also include the change in Long Term Assets during the period from the balance sheet. 
The reason for this is that Depreciation reduces the value of assets, similar to if an item were sold. By showing the change in asset value along with the Net Income, the effect of Depreciation as an expense (debit) will be offset by the reduction in Assets (credit), resulting in no change in Working Capital caused by Depreciation.
Similarly, this caution applies to other non-cash items such as Gain or Loss from Sale of Assets and changes in deferred taxes. As long as the Net Income is presented together with the change in Long Term Assets and Long Term Liabilities, the impact of these non-cash items on Working Capital can be accurately assessed. 
To maintain consistency in the Projection to Actual Comparison, the actual amount for the Assets should be the Gross amount without the reduction for Accumulated Depreciation/Amortization. This ensures that the analysis accurately reflects the impact of non-cash items on Working Capital.

Question: What is an example of a non-cash expense that should not affect Working Capital?
Answer: An example of a non-cash expense that should not affect Working Capital is Depreciation. Depreciation is a non-cash expense that is included in the Net Income but does not have a direct impact on the cash flow of a business. It represents the allocation of the cost of an asset over its useful life. While Depreciation is included in the calculation of Net Income, it should not be considered as a factor that affects Working Capital because it does not involve the inflow or outflow of cash.

Question: How should the actual amount for Assets be calculated in the Projection to Actual Comparison?
Answer: In the Projection to Actual Comparison, the actual amount for Assets should be calculated as the Gross amount without the reduction for Accumulated Depreciation/Amortization. This means that the value of the Assets should not take into account any depreciation or amortization that has been recorded. The purpose of this is to ensure consistency when comparing the change in Working Capital with the Net Income, as depreciation is a non-cash expense that should not affect Working Capital. By excluding the reduction in asset value due to depreciation, the effect of depreciation as an expense will be offset by the reduction in Assets, resulting in no change in Working Capital caused by depreciation. This same principle applies to other non-cash items such as gain or loss from the sale of assets and changes in deferred taxes, as long as the Net Income is shown together with the change in Long Term Assets and Long Term Liabilities.

Question: What other non-cash items should be considered when analyzing Working Capital?
Answer: When analyzing Working Capital, it is important to consider other non-cash items in addition to Depreciation/Amortization. These include:
1. Gain or Loss from Sale of Assets: If there have been any gains or losses from the sale of assets during the period, these should be taken into account. Gains would increase Working Capital, while losses would decrease it.
2. Change in Deferred Taxes: Any changes in deferred taxes should also be considered. If there is an increase in deferred taxes, it would decrease Working Capital, and if there is a decrease, it would increase Working Capital.
It is crucial to include these non-cash items in the analysis to accurately assess the change in Working Capital and understand the factors that have influenced it.
