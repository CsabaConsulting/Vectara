Question: What is the Equity Percent Ownership interest used for?
Answer: The Equity Percent Ownership interest is used as an input in Step 8 of the analysis. It represents the percentage of ownership that each Equity Group has in the total Company. This input helps determine the distribution of equity among the different Equity Groups. However, it is important to note that in the *ThruThink* analysis, the actual ownership of the total Company is attributed based on the percent of equity contributed by each Equity Group, rather than solely relying on the stated Equity Percent inputs made by the User in Step 8.

Question: How should the cash Equity contributions be made by each Equity Group?
Answer: The cash Equity contributions by each Equity Group should be made in the same percentage as the Equity Group's percent ownership inputs. In other words, the equity contributions by the Equity members should be in the same percentage as the stated ownership percent inputs. If an Equity Group contributes more cash than their ownership percentage, the excess amount can be contributed as an Equity Note, which will become a loan to the Company. This Equity Note can have zero interest or any other interest rate as desired. By doing this, the Equity split of the total Company can be kept consistent with the Equity Percent Ownership of the Equity Groups. Additionally, cash over the Equity Group's ownership equity percentage may be contributed as a Subordinated Debt, where Warrant options and/or Payment-in-Kind (PIK) Interest can be used to share the success of the Company's future performance with the note holder.

Question: How is the equity split of the total Company determined in the *ThruThink* analysis?
Answer: In the *ThruThink* analysis, the equity split of the total Company is determined based on the actual percent of equity contributed by each Equity Group, rather than the stated Equity Percent Ownership inputs made by the User in Step 8. The cash equity contributions by each Equity Group should be made in the same percentage as the Equity Group's percent ownership inputs. This means that each Equity Group's ownership of the total Company is attributed based on the actual percent of equity contributed.
If an Equity Group contributes cash amounts that are over their ownership equity percentages, these excess contributions can be made as an Equity Note, which will become a loan to the Company. The Equity Note can have a zero interest rate or any other interest rate desired. This allows the Equity split of the total Company to remain consistent with the Equity Percent Ownership of the Equity Groups.
Additionally, cash contributions that exceed an Equity Group's ownership equity percentage can also be made as a Subordinated Debt. This debt can include Warrant options and/or Payment-in-Kind (PIK) Interest, which allows the note holder to share in the success of the Company's future performance.
When the Existing Company is combined with or purchases the Target Company, the resulting equity split becomes more complicated. The Existing Company's existing equity becomes part of the total Company equity, along with the equity contributions of the Equity Groups to purchase the Target Company. Each Equity Group's actual equity split of the Future Company (combined Target Company and Existing Company) is determined by the cash equity contributions and the Existing Company's net equity.
It is important to note that the resulting equity splits may not necessarily be the same as the Equity Percent Ownership inputs entered by the User in Step 8. The use of Equity Notes or Subordinated Debt by the non-Existing Company Equity Groups can be used to account for their contributions. The resulting equity splits will be listed in the message section on the bottom of the Step 8 input page. If Equity Notes or Subordinated Debt is not used, the Equity Group's Ownership Percentages can be adjusted to come close to the splits shown in the note section of the page, through several rounds of adjustments.

Question: What can be done if the cash amounts contributed by the Equity Groups are over their ownership equity percentages?
Answer: If the cash amounts contributed by the Equity Groups are over their ownership equity percentages, there are a few options that can be considered to keep the financial equity split consistent with the equity percent ownership inputs:
1. Equity Notes: The excess cash amounts contributed by the Equity Groups can be recorded as an Equity Note. This means that the excess cash will become a loan to the company. The Equity Note can have a zero interest rate or any other interest rate as desired.
2. Subordinated Debt: Another option is to contribute the excess cash as Subordinated Debt. This means that the Equity Groups can provide the cash as a loan to the company, and in return, they can receive Warrant options and/or Payment-in-Kind (PIK) Interest. These options allow the note holders to share in the success of the company's future performance.
By utilizing Equity Notes or Subordinated Debt, the equity split of the total company can be kept consistent with the equity percent ownership of the Equity Groups. It is important to note that the use of these options may result in a more complicated equity split, especially when there are multiple Equity Groups involved. Therefore, it is recommended to refer to the Information Browser - Balance Sheet Beginning Equity Detail for a visual representation and specific details of the resulting equity group splits.

Question: What are some options for contributing cash over the Equity Group's ownership equity percentage?
Answer: In the given text, there are two options mentioned for contributing cash over the Equity Group's ownership equity percentage:
1. Equity Notes: Cash amounts contributed by the Equity Groups that are over their ownership equity percentages can be contributed as an Equity Note. This is a loan to the Company and can be at zero interest or any other interest rate desired. By using Equity Notes, the financial Equity split can be kept consistent with the Equity Percent Ownership of the Equity Groups.
2. Subordinated Debt: Cash over the Equity Group's ownership equity percentage may also be contributed as Subordinated Debt. This involves providing a loan to the Company with additional terms such as Warrant options and/or Payment-in-Kind (PIK) Interest. These terms allow the note holder to share in the success of the Company's future performance. More information about Subordinated Debt can be found in the Information Browser - Subordinated Debt section.
It is important to note that these options are mentioned in the context of combining or purchasing the Target Company with the Existing Company, and when there are other Equity Groups involved. The resulting equity splits may not necessarily be the same as the Equity Percent Ownership inputs entered by the User in Step 8. Adjustments to the Equity Group's Ownership Percentages may be required to align them with the resulting splits indicated in the note section of the Step 8 Equity Inputs. The Information Browser - Balance Sheet Beginning Equity Detail provides a visual representation and specific details of the resulting Equity Group equity splits.

Question: What happens when the Existing Company is combined with or purchases the Target Company?
Answer: When the Existing Company is combined with or purchases the Target Company, the resulting equity split will depend on the equity contributions made by the Equity Groups and the net equity of the Existing Company. The cash equity contributions from each Equity Group should be made in the same percentage as their stated ownership percent inputs. However, in order to keep the financial equity split consistent with the equity percent ownership inputs, any cash amounts contributed by the Equity Groups that are over their ownership equity percentages can be contributed as an Equity Note, which will become a loan to the Company. This loan can have zero interest or any other interest rate as desired.
Additionally, cash over the Equity Group's ownership equity percentage may be contributed as a Subordinated Debt. This debt can include options for Warrants and/or Payment-in-Kind (PIK) Interest, which allows the note holder to share in the success of the Company's future performance.
It is important to note that the resulting equity splits may not necessarily be the same as the equity percent ownership inputs entered by the User in Step 8. The use of Equity Notes or Subordinated Debt by the non-Existing Company Equity Groups can be used to account for their contributions. The resulting equity splits will be listed in the message section at the bottom of the Step 8 input page. If Equity Notes or Subordinated Debt is not used for the non-Existing Company Equity Group's cash contributions, and it is acceptable to all of the Equity Groups, the Equity Group's Ownership Percentages can be adjusted to come close to the ones shown in the note section of the page. This may require several rounds of adjustments to achieve approximate alignment between the two percentage splits.

Question: Will the resulting equity splits be the same as the Equity Percent Ownership inputs entered by the User?
Answer: No, the resulting equity splits will not necessarily be the same as the Equity Percent Ownership inputs entered by the User. In the *ThruThink* analysis, each Equity Group's ownership of the total Company is determined by the actual percent of equity contributed, rather than the stated Equity Percent inputs made by the User in Step 8. The cash equity contributions by each Equity Group should be made in the same percentage as their stated ownership percent inputs. However, if an Equity Group contributes cash amounts that are over their ownership equity percentages, these excess contributions can be made as an Equity Note, which will become a loan to the Company. This allows the Equity split of the total Company to remain consistent with the Equity Percent Ownership of the Equity Groups. Additionally, cash over the Equity Group's ownership equity percentage can be contributed as a Subordinated Debt, where Warrant options and/or Payment-in-Kind (PIK) Interest can be used to share the success of the Company's future performance with the note holder. Therefore, the resulting equity splits will depend on the actual equity contributions made by each Equity Group, including any contributions made through Equity Notes or Subordinated Debt.

Question: How can the Equity Group's Ownership Percentages be adjusted if Equity Notes or Subordinated Debt is not used for the non-Existing Company Equity Group's cash contributions?
Answer: If Equity Notes or Subordinated Debt is not used for the non-Existing Company Equity Group's cash contributions, and it is acceptable to all of the Equity Groups, the Equity Group's Ownership Percentages can be adjusted. This adjustment is done in order to make the Ownership Percentages approximately close to the ones indicated in the note section of the Step 8 Equity Inputs.
To adjust the Ownership Percentages, several rounds of adjustments may be required, typically around four or five rounds. The goal is to align the Ownership Percentages with the Equity Group splits shown in the note section of the page.
It is important to note that the adjustment of Ownership Percentages is relational to one another. This means that changing one Ownership Percentage may impact the others, requiring further adjustments to achieve the desired outcome.
To get the Ownership Percentages close to the ones in the note section of the page, the User should carefully review the resulting Equity Group Splits indicated in the note section of the Step 8 Equity Inputs. Additionally, the User can refer to the Information Browser - Balance Sheet Beginning Equity Detail for a visual representation and specific details of the resulting Equity Group equity splits.
