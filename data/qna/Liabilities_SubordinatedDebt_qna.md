Question: What is subordinated debt?
Answer: Subordinated debt, also known as sub debt, is a type of secondary debt that is considered lower in priority compared to senior secured debt and potentially other debt obligations. It is backed by the value of the company, typically before any payment of seller debt, equity debt, and equity holders. Subordinated debt carries more risk than other types of debt, and as a result, the terms associated with subordinated debt are usually more complex.
In the context of the *ThruThink* analysis, subordinated debt can include provisions for payment in kind interest and warrants, which provide the lender of subordinated debt with opportunities to be compensated for the higher risk involved.
Additionally, the analysis allows for cash flow control payments to be made towards subordinated debt. These payments are in addition to any regularly scheduled payments and can be used to manage cash flow by either paying down debt or drawing new debt to supplement cash.
Repayment of subordinated debt can be structured in different ways. The transaction sheet subordinated debt can be repaid either through interest-only payments with the entire principal amount due in the last year of the loan or through level annual principal and interest payments throughout the loan term. The user also has the option to enter individually scheduled subordinated debt with up to six separate debts, each with four repayment options: interest only, amortized level payment, and level principal plus interest.
It is important to note that subordinated debt often carries a higher interest rate compared to senior debt. If the company has excess cash, it may choose to pay down the higher interest rate subordinated debt before the end of the debt term. However, there is usually a prepayment penalty associated with early pay down of subordinated debt. The prepayment penalty, expressed as a percentage, applies to the principal portion of all subordinated debt in the analysis and will reduce cash and be considered an expense in the year of payment. The specific prepayment percentage is an input on the subordinated prepayment penalty input page.

Question: What is the collateral for subordinated debt?
Answer: The collateral for subordinated debt is the value of the company, typically prior to any payment of seller debt and equity debt, and prior to the equity holders.
---
Question: What are the terms of subordinated debt usually like?
Answer: The terms of subordinated debt are usually more complicated compared to other types of debt. Subordinated debt is subordinate to senior secured debt and may also be subordinate to other debt, depending on the terms of the sub debt. The collateral for subordinated debt is typically the value of the company, usually before any payment of seller debt and equity debt, and prior to the equity holders. There is more risk associated with subordinated debt, which is why the terms are more complex. The *ThruThink* analysis includes provisions for payment in kind interest and warrants to compensate the subordinated debt lender for the higher risk.
---
Question: What provisions does the *ThruThink* analysis have for subordinated debt?
Answer: The *ThruThink* analysis has provisions for Payment in Kind Interest and Warrants for subordinated debt. These provisions provide the subordinated debt lender with the opportunity to be compensated for the higher risk associated with subordinated debt.

Question: What are cash flow control payments for subordinated debt?
Answer: Cash flow control payments for subordinated debt refer to additional payments that can be made on top of the regularly scheduled payments on the subordinated debt. These payments are entered on the Cash Flow Control page and are intended to manage cash by either using extra cash flow to pay down debt or, if necessary, drawing new debt to supplement cash.
When making cash flow control payments, a positive number is entered for payments. These payments are first applied to the outstanding interest on the subordinated debt listed on the Transaction Sheet, followed by the principal amount, and then any payment-in-kind (PIK) interest. Once the subordinated debt on the Transaction Sheet is paid off, the payments are then allocated to the outstanding interest, principal, and PIK interest of specifically scheduled subordinated debt items based on the percentage of their outstanding balances.
On the other hand, if a negative number is entered, it represents a draw on the loan. Draws are only made to the subordinated debt listed on the Transaction Sheet. If a draw is made after the loan term has expired and the original loan has been paid off, the amount of the cash flow control payment or adjustment will create a new loan balance until it is adjusted again with either another cash flow control adjustment or an adjusting journal entry (AJE). Interest will be paid on the balance annually until it is paid off with another cash flow control adjustment or AJE.
It's important to note that additional payments made through cash flow control will first be applied to regular interest, then principal, and finally PIK interest of the subordinated debt. However, these additional payments will not reduce warrants associated with the subordinated debt.
---
Question: How are payments on the cash flow control page allocated?
Answer: Payments on the Cash Flow Control page are allocated in a specific order. First, the payments are applied to the outstanding interest on the Sub Debt listed on the Transaction Sheet. Once the interest is paid off, the payments are then applied to the outstanding principal of the Sub Debt. If there is still remaining cash flow, it will be allocated to the Payment in Kind (PIK) Interest until it is fully paid off. 
After the Transaction Sheet Sub Debt is paid off, any remaining payments will be allocated to the Specifically Scheduled Sub Debt items based on the percentage of their outstanding balances. This means that the payments will be applied to the outstanding interest, principal, and PIK Interest of the Specifically Scheduled Sub Debt items in proportion to their respective balances. 
It is important to note that additional payments made on the Cash Flow Control page will not reduce the Warrants associated with the Sub Debt.

Question: What happens if a negative number is entered for a draw on the loan?
Answer: If a negative number is entered for a draw on the loan, it means that the borrower is requesting to repay a portion of the loan instead of drawing additional funds. In other words, it indicates that the borrower wants to make a payment towards the outstanding balance of the loan. This payment will be applied to the Transaction Sheet Sub Debt, which is the specific subordinated debt associated with the loan. 
It's important to note that if a draw or adjustment is made after the loan term has expired and the original loan has been paid off, the amount of the negative draw or adjustment will create a new loan balance. Interest will be paid on this balance annually until it is paid off with either another adjustment or a cash flow control adjustment. 
In summary, entering a negative number for a draw on the loan allows the borrower to make a payment towards the outstanding balance of the subordinated debt associated with the loan.

Question: What will additional payments to subordinated debt be applied to first?
Answer: Additional payments to subordinated debt will be applied first to the regular interest, then to the principal, and finally to the payment in kind (PIK) interest.
---
Question: Will additional payments to subordinated debt reduce warrants?
Answer: No, additional payments to subordinated debt will not reduce warrants. The text states that additional payments to the subordinated debt will be applied first to regular interest, then to principal, and then to PIK (Payment in Kind) interest. However, it does not mention that these payments will reduce warrants.

Question: What are the repayment options for transaction sheet subordinated debt?
Answer: The repayment options for transaction sheet subordinated debt are as follows:
1. Interest Only: If "Yes" is selected on the Transaction Sheet Sub Debt Input page, the loan will be interest only. This means that during the loan term, only annual interest payments will be made, and the entire principal amount will be due in the last year of the loan.
2. Amortized: If "No" is selected on the Transaction Sheet Sub Debt Input page, the loan will be amortized. This means that the loan will be repaid with level annual principal and interest payments throughout the life of the loan. The last annual payment will fully pay off the loan.
It is important to note that if other repayment terms are required, the user has the option to use the Individually Scheduled Item Input process to enter sub debt with different repayment options.
---
Question: How can the user enter subordinated debt with other repayment options?
Answer: If the user wants to enter subordinated debt with repayment options other than the default options provided, they can use the Individually Scheduled Item Input process. On the Individually Scheduled Item Input page, there is a section specifically for subordinated debt. In this section, the user can enter up to six individual separate sub debts, each with four separate repayment options. The repayment options available for each sub debt are:
1. Interest Only: The loan will be interest-only, meaning that only interest payments will be made during the loan term, and the entire principal amount will be due in the last year of the loan.
2. Amortized Level Payment: The loan will be amortized, with level annual principal and interest payments made throughout the life of the loan. This means that the loan will be paid off gradually over time, with the last annual payment being made in the last year of the loan.
3. Level Principal plus Interest: This option also involves level annual principal and interest payments, but the principal and interest amounts will be higher compared to the amortized level payment option. This means that the loan will be paid off faster, with the last annual payment being made in the last year of the loan.
By using the Individually Scheduled Item Input process, the user can customize the repayment terms for each subordinated debt to meet their specific requirements.

Question: Why is subordinated debt often at a higher interest rate than senior debt?
Answer: Subordinated debt is often at a higher interest rate than senior debt due to its subordinate position in the capital structure. Subordinated debt holders have a lower priority of repayment in the event of bankruptcy or liquidation compared to senior debt holders. This means that if a company faces financial distress, senior debt holders will be paid back first before subordinated debt holders receive any repayment.
The higher interest rate compensates subordinated debt holders for the increased risk they bear. Since they are more likely to face losses in the event of default, the higher interest rate helps to offset this risk and provide a higher potential return on investment. Additionally, the terms of subordinated debt are usually more complicated, reflecting the increased risk associated with this type of debt.
It is important to note that the interest rate on subordinated debt can vary depending on market conditions, the creditworthiness of the borrower, and other factors.

Question: What is a prepayment penalty for subordinated debt?
Answer: A prepayment penalty for subordinated debt refers to a fee or penalty that is imposed when the borrower pays off the principal portion of the debt before the agreed-upon maturity date. Subordinated debt is a type of debt that is subordinate to senior secured debt and may also be subordinate to other debt. It carries a higher level of risk compared to other types of debt.
In the context of the *ThruThink* analysis, the prepayment penalty applies to the prepayment of the principal portion of all subordinated debt in the transaction sheet, existing company, and individually scheduled subordinated debt. The penalty is designed to compensate the debt holder for the early pay down of the debt, as the term of the subordinated debt is often integral in providing a certain desired rate of return on the investment for the debt holder.
The prepayment penalty is expressed as a percentage and is an input on the subordinated prepayment penalty input page. When a prepayment is made, the penalty amount will reduce cash and be recorded as an expense in the year of payment. This penalty serves as a deterrent for borrowers to pay off the debt early and helps ensure that the debt holder receives the expected return on their investment.
---
Question: What does the prepayment penalty apply to?
Answer: The prepayment penalty applies to the prepayment of the principal portion of all Subordinate Debt in the Transaction Sheet, Existing Company, and the Individually Scheduled Subordinate Debt. This includes all the Subordinate Debt in the analysis. The penalty will reduce cash and be an expense in the year of payment.
---
Question: Where can the user input the subordinate prepayment percentage?
Answer: The user can input the subordinate prepayment percentage on the "Subordinate Prepayment Penalty Input" page.
