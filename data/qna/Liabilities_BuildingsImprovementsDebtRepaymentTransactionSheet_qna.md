Question: What is the formula for calculating the principal repayment on the Building & Improvement Debt?
Answer: The formula for calculating the principal repayment on the Building & Improvement Debt is as follows: 
Principal = 1 / Remaining years of the loan
For example, if you have a 10-year loan, the principal repayment for each year would be calculated as follows:
Year 1: Principal repayment = 1 / 10 = 10%
Year 2: Principal repayment = 1 / 9 = 11.1%
Year 3: Principal repayment = 1 / 8 = 12.5%
This formula allows for the calculation of the principal repayment based on the remaining years of the loan. It is important to note that if there are any additional advances or payments made during the life of the loan, the loan duration is reset to the original term, and the principal repayment calculation will adjust accordingly. Additionally, if a Balloon Year is indicated by the user, the remaining balance of the loan is paid off in that year, including any advances made in the previous year. 
If the user requires other principal repayment options such as amortized, level principal, monthly payments, quarterly payments, etc., they should utilize the Individually Scheduled Item Input option.

Question: How is the principal repayment amount calculated for each year of a 10-year loan?
Answer: The principal repayment amount for each year of a 10-year loan is calculated by dividing 1 by the remaining years of the loan. For example, in a 10-year loan:
- Year 1 principal repayment will be 1/10 or 10%
- Year 2 principal repayment will be 1/9 or 11.1%
- Year 3 principal repayment will be 1/8 or 12.5%
This calculation is based on the outstanding balance of the loan at the prior year end and includes both the interest on the outstanding balance and the principal repayment. It is important to note that if there are any additional advances or payments made during the life of the loan, the loan duration is reset to the original term, and the principal repayment calculation will adjust accordingly. Additionally, if a Balloon Year is indicated by the user, the remaining balance of the loan is paid off in that year, including any advances made in the previous year.
