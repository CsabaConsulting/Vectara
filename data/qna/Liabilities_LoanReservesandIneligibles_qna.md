Question: What is the purpose of the Ineligible or Reserve percentage in the loan amount calculations?
Answer: The purpose of the Ineligible or Reserve percentage in the loan amount calculations is to account for assets that are not of reasonable value or condition to serve as loan collateral. This includes items such as old, spoiled, or obsolete inventory, as well as accounts receivables that are over 60 days old and may be uncollectable. The Ineligible or Reserve percentage reduces the asset value before applying the Loan to Value percentage, which determines the amount of the loan. This ensures that the loan amount is based on the value of the collateral that can be converted to cash to pay off the loan. Additionally, the Ineligible or Reserve percentage can be used to plan for possible value differences with the lender or any other reason to reduce the asset value for lending purposes.

Question: How are Ineligibles defined in the context of loan Collateral?
Answer: In the context of loan collateral, Ineligibles refer to a portion of the asset that is not considered suitable or valuable enough to serve as collateral for a loan. This can include items such as old, spoiled, or obsolete inventory, aged accounts receivables, or any other factor that the lender believes may hinder the ability of the collateral to be converted into cash for loan repayment. Ineligibles are deducted from the asset value before applying the Loan to Value percentage to determine the loan amount. Lenders often use a predetermined percentage for Ineligibles, especially for certain types of inventory or accounts receivables that are over 60 days old and may be deemed uncollectable. Additionally, in the *ThruThink* analysis, there is an option to input an Ineligible amount or percentage for other senior debt categories besides accounts receivables and inventory, allowing users to account for potential differences in asset value with the lender or any other reason to reduce the asset value for lending purposes.

Question: What is the purpose of Loan Reserves?
Answer: The purpose of Loan Reserves is to account for unforeseen situations that may reduce the value of collateral and hinder its ability to be converted into cash to pay off a loan. Loan Reserves serve as a buffer to protect lenders from potential losses by setting aside funds to cover any potential decrease in collateral value. These reserves are typically used when collateral, such as inventory or accounts receivable, is deemed ineligible or of lower value due to factors like age, spoilage, obsolescence, or uncollectability. By reducing the collateral value by the Ineligible/Reserve percentage, lenders can determine the appropriate loan amount based on the remaining value of the collateral after accounting for potential risks. In the *ThruThink* analysis, Loan Reserves can be expressed as a percentage of the total loan collateral value, and the loan amount is calculated by reducing the collateral value by the Reserve percentage before applying the Loan to Value percentage.

Question: In addition to a percentage, what other provision can be entered for Inventory in the loan amount calculation?
Answer: In addition to a percentage, another provision that can be entered for Inventory in the loan amount calculation is an amount for a Loan Reserve. This provision allows for a fixed value of Inventory to be removed from the loan amount calculation. This can be useful in cases where there is a specific portion of Inventory that needs to be excluded from the collateral value for lending purposes.

Question: Are receivables from foreign sales typically considered eligible or ineligible for lending purposes?
Answer: Receivables from foreign sales are typically considered ineligible for lending purposes. The text states that "Receivables from foreign Sales (customers in another country) are often considered ineligible receivables for lending purposes." This means that lenders do not consider these receivables as suitable collateral for loans.

Question: What types of inventory and accounts receivables are generally subject to an Ineligible/Reserve amount?
Answer: According to the provided text, lenders typically apply an Ineligible/Reserve amount to certain types of inventory and accounts receivables. Specifically, this applies to old, spoiled, or obsolete inventory, as well as accounts receivables that are over 60 days old and potentially uncollectable. These categories of inventory and accounts receivables are considered ineligible for lending purposes, and the Ineligible/Reserve amount is used to reduce the asset value when calculating the loan amount.

Question: Besides Accounts Receivables and Inventory, which other senior debt categories have an Ineligible provision in the ThruThink analysis?
Answer: In the ThruThink analysis, besides Accounts Receivables and Inventory, the other senior debt categories that have an Ineligible provision are Machinery & Equipment, Buildings & Improvements, and Real Estate Debt. These categories also include a provision for an Ineligible or Reserve percentage, which is used to reduce the asset value before applying the Loan to Value percentage to determine the loan amount. The Ineligible provision allows for the consideration of assets that may not be of reasonable value or condition to serve as loan collateral, thereby accounting for any factors that could hinder the conversion of collateral into cash to repay the loan.

Question: How is the Ineligible or Reserve expressed in the ThruThink analysis?
Answer: In the ThruThink analysis, the Ineligible or Reserve is expressed as a percentage of the total loan Collateral value. This means that the loan amount calculations will reduce the asset value by the Ineligible/Reserve percentage before applying the Loan to Value percentage to determine the amount of the loan. The Ineligible or Reserve can be used by the user to plan for possible value differences with the lender or any reason to reduce the asset value for lending purposes. Additionally, the Ineligible Input can be left empty, and the Loan to Value Ratio can be reduced to achieve the same purpose.

Question: How does the Ineligible or Reserve percentage affect the calculation of the available loan amount?
Answer: The Ineligible or Reserve percentage affects the calculation of the available loan amount by reducing the asset value before applying the Loan to Value percentage. This means that the loan amount is calculated based on a lower value of the collateral, taking into account any assets that are deemed ineligible or reserves for unforeseen situations. 
For example, if there is a 10% Ineligible or Reserve percentage and the collateral value is $100,000, the loan amount will be calculated based on $90,000 ($100,000 - 10%). This reduction in asset value helps account for assets that may not be of reasonable value or condition to serve as loan collateral, such as old, spoiled, or obsolete inventory, or accounts receivables that are over 60 days old and possibly uncollectable.
In the case of inventory, there is also an option to enter a fixed value for a Loan Reserve in addition to a percentage. This allows for the removal of a specific amount of inventory from the loan amount calculation.
In the *ThruThink* analysis, the Ineligible provision can be used for all senior debt categories besides accounts receivables and inventory. The Ineligible input can be left empty to simply reduce the Loan to Value ratio if there are any reasons to reduce the asset value for lending purposes. The Ineligible or Reserve percentage is expressed as a percentage of the total loan collateral value, and the loan amount is calculated by reducing the collateral value by the Reserve percentage before applying the Loan to Value percentage.
