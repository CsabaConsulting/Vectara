Question: What is considered real property in a company purchase?
Answer: In a company purchase, real property refers to assets such as real estate, buildings, and improvements that are not included in the sale of the company. These assets may be owned by the seller or another party who will continue to retain ownership after the sale, or they may be leased by the company from another party. Real property is distinct from personal property, which includes movable equipment. The distinction between real property and personal property can sometimes be vague, and different taxing authorities may apply property taxes differently to these categories. In the context of the ThruThink analysis, real property is defined as fixed permanent assets like real estate, buildings, and improvements.
