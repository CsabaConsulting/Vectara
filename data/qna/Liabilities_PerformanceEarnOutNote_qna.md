Question: What is the Performance Earn Out Note?
Answer: The Performance Earn Out Note is a debt obligation that is used to pay the holder of the Earn Out option. It is categorized as a liability and can be found in the Transaction Debt Section of Step 6. The terms of the Earn Out option can be accessed in Step 4 or in the Information Browser by searching for "Earn Out". The Performance Earn Out Note is used as an incentive for the Seller or any other individual or entity that a Performance Earn Out might be applicable. It is a way to offer a share of the future performance of the Company to the Seller, a Lender, or an Investor who require a greater upside. The calculation and payment of the Performance Earn Out Note are determined by the debt terms set up by the User in Step 6. It is important to note that if the Earn Out Note has a Beginning Payment Year that is less than the end year of the Earn Out Duration period, it may result in a negative loan balance, which can impact the amortized purchase price or the Earn Out expense deduction. Therefore, it is generally recommended to begin the Earn Out payments after the end of the Duration Period to avoid any potential issues.

Question: How is the Performance Earn Out treated for the Seller?
Answer: For the Seller, the Performance Earn Out can be treated in two ways. Firstly, it can be considered as a part of the purchase price of the Company and capitalized in the year it is earned. This means that it will be treated as an increase in the amortized asset from the purchase of the Company. Alternatively, it can be expensed in the year it is earned. In both cases, the Earn Out is calculated each year and will accrue as a Performance Earn Out Note in the Transaction Debt Section of Step 6. The payment of the Performance Earn Out Note will be made in accordance with the debt terms set up by the User for the Performance Earn Out Note in Step 6.

Question: What caution is given regarding payments before the end of the Earn Out Duration period?
Answer: The caution given regarding payments before the end of the Earn Out Duration period is that if the Earn Out Note has a Beginning Payment Year that is less than the end year of the Earn Out Duration period, it may result in a negative loan balance. This negative loan balance will either be zeroed out and increase the amortized purchase price for the Company if the Earn Out is part of the Company purchase, or it will increase the Earn Out expense deduction if the Earn Out is expensed. It is important to note that once a negative Earn Out Note is created, there is no provision to recover that amount if Company Performance recovers later during the Duration Period. Therefore, it is advised to begin the Earn Out payments after the end of the Duration Period to avoid any potential negative loan balance.
