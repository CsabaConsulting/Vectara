Question: What are Individually Scheduled Other Debt?
Answer: Individually Scheduled Other Debt refers to individual short-term liabilities that are either beginning balances or funded in specific months for each year of the Horizon Period. These debts are paid off 12 months later. Each separate debt item may have a different interest rate or no interest at all. These debts can be applied to either the Transaction Sheet or directly to the Existing Company during Debt Setup. The entire category of Individually Scheduled Other Debt can be renewed each year by selecting 'Yes' for any given year in the Other Current Debt Detail page. This renewal extends all of the monthly anniversaries for that year for 12 months. The interest on these debts is paid annually at each of the liabilities' anniversary dates. It is important to note that if the debt is due in a period longer than 12 months from the Effective Date, it should be categorized as Other Long Term Debt on the Balance Sheet.

Question: How can the 12 Month Anniversary Payoff payment month be changed for Individually Scheduled Other Current Loans?
Answer: To change the 12 Month Anniversary Payoff payment month for Individually Scheduled Other Current Loans, negative amounts can be used. This should only be done when the Renewal is set to 'No' for the year in question.
Here are the steps to change the payment month:
1. By default, the payoff for each Individually Scheduled Other Current Loan will be paid off (unless renewed) in the next year, 12 months after the Funding Month.
2. If the payoff needs to be earlier in the Payoff Year, enter a negative loan amount for the payoff in the desired month and enter the Payoff Year as the Funding Year. In the Description Field, enter 'Move' for that amount.
3. Enter another corresponding positive amount in the 12 month anniversary month in the Payoff Year for the original loan amount. Again, enter 'Move' in the Description Field for that entry.
4. This effectively moves the payoff from the original 12 month anniversary month to the new required month in the Payoff Year.
5. It is important to note that this option should only be used when the Renewal is set to 'No' for the year with the negative amounts.
6. Similarly, if the payoff needs to be later in the same year as the Funding Year and not in the Succeeding Year, enter a negative loan amount for the payoff in the desired month (must be after the Funding Month of the original loan) for the Funding Year. Enter 'Move' in the Description Field for that amount.
7. Enter a positive amount in the 12 month anniversary month of the original loan in the Succeeding Year. Again, enter 'Move' in the Description Field for that entry.
8. This effectively moves the payoff from the original 12 month anniversary month to the new required month in the same year as the Funding Year.
9. Remember to enter 'Move' in the Description Field for both the positive and negative adjustment amounts when entering negative amounts to move the payment month.
Please note that the Individually Scheduled portion of the Other Current Debt can be renewed annually by selecting 'Yes' on the Other Current Debt page. This will extend the loan anniversaries by 12 months.
