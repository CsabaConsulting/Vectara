Question: What happens to the Cash Requirement in the Closing Escrow when a % Points Fee is used for the Equity Note?
Answer: When a % Points Fee is used for the Equity Note, the Cash Requirement in the Closing Escrow will be affected. Changing the amount of the Equity Note will cause the Cash Requirement to close the escrow to either go up or down based on the amount of the % Points Fee change. If the Equity Note increases, the Cash Requirement will also increase due to the % Points Fee. This can create a never-ending chase to provide the remaining Cash Requirement, although the increase in the requirement will become smaller over time. To satisfy the final Cash Requirement, you can either use a direct Cash Contribution or make multiple rounds of increasing the Equity Note amount until the Remaining Cash Requirement becomes small enough to be covered by a direct Cash Contribution.

Question: How does changing the amount of the Equity Note affect the Cash Requirement?
Answer: When using the Equity Note to fulfill the Cash Requirement, any changes made to the amount of the Equity Note will have an impact on the Cash Requirement. Specifically, if a percentage Origination Points Fee is applied to the Equity Note, altering the amount of the Equity Note will cause the Cash Requirement to increase or decrease accordingly based on the change in the percentage Points Fee.
In other words, increasing the amount of the Equity Note will result in an increase in the Cash Requirement due to the percentage Points Fee. This creates a continuous cycle where the Remaining Cash Requirement keeps growing (although the increments become smaller) as the Equity Note amount is increased to meet the new Cash Requirement. This cycle continues until the Remaining Cash Requirement becomes small enough to be covered by a direct Cash Contribution, or multiple rounds of increasing the Equity Note amount are made to satisfy the Remaining Cash Requirement.
Therefore, it is important to consider the impact of changing the amount of the Equity Note on the Cash Requirement and decide whether to use a direct Cash Contribution or adjust the Equity Note amount accordingly to meet the Remaining Cash Requirement.

Question: What happens to the Cash Requirement when the Equity Note is increased?
Answer: When the Equity Note is increased, the Cash Requirement to close the escrow will also increase. This is because the % Origination Points Fee for the Equity Note becomes a Cash Requirement in the closing escrow. Therefore, any change in the amount of the Equity Note will cause the Cash Requirement to go up or down based on the amount of the % Points Fee change. 
If the Equity Note is being used to provide the final amount of the Cash Requirement, increasing the Equity Note will result in an increase in the Cash Requirement. This creates a never-ending chase to provide the remaining Cash Requirement, although the increase in the Cash Requirement will become smaller with each round of increasing the Equity Note amount. 
To satisfy the Remaining Cash Requirement, there are two options. The first option is to use a direct Cash Contribution to fulfill the final Cash Requirement. The second option is to make several rounds of increasing the Equity Note amount to satisfy the Remaining Cash Requirement, and then increase the Equity Note amount again for the resulting Remaining Cash Requirement. This process continues until the Remaining Cash Requirement becomes small enough to be covered by a direct Cash Contribution, effectively finishing the process.

Question: What is the suggested alternative to using the Equity Note to satisfy the final Cash Requirement?
Answer: The suggested alternative to using the Equity Note to satisfy the final Cash Requirement is to use a direct Cash Contribution. Instead of increasing the amount of the Equity Note multiple times to meet the Remaining Cash Requirement, it is recommended to make a direct Cash Contribution to fulfill the remaining amount. This avoids the need for a never-ending chase to provide the Remaining Cash Requirement and simplifies the process.

Question: What is the suggested approach if the Remaining Cash Requirement is not satisfied by the initial Equity Note amount?
Answer: If the initial Equity Note amount does not satisfy the Remaining Cash Requirement, there are two suggested approaches mentioned in the documentation. 
The first approach is to use a direct Cash Contribution to fulfill the final Cash Requirement. This means providing additional cash to cover the remaining amount needed. 
The second approach is to make several rounds of increasing the Equity Note amount. By increasing the Equity Note amount, the Cash Requirement will also increase due to the % Points Fee. This process may need to be repeated multiple times until the Remaining Cash Requirement becomes small enough to be covered by a direct Cash Contribution. 
It is important to note that using the Equity Note to satisfy the Remaining Cash Requirement may result in a never-ending chase, albeit with increasingly smaller increments, due to the % Points Fee. Therefore, it is recommended to consider using a direct Cash Contribution if possible to avoid this continuous adjustment process.

Question: What happens to the Remaining Cash Requirement as the Equity Note amount is increased?
Answer: As the Equity Note amount is increased, the Remaining Cash Requirement will also increase. This is because when a percentage Origination Points Fee is used for the Equity Note, the fee becomes a Cash Requirement in the Closing Escrow. Therefore, any change in the amount of the Equity Note will cause the Cash Requirement to close the escrow to go up or down based on the amount of the percentage Points Fee change.
When using the Equity Note to provide the final amount of the Cash Requirement, increasing the Equity Note amount will result in an increase in the Cash Requirement due to the percentage Points Fee. This can create a never-ending (although increasingly smaller) chase to provide the remaining Cash Requirement.
To satisfy the Remaining Cash Requirement, there are two options. The first option is to use a direct Cash Contribution to fulfill the final Cash Requirement. The second option is to make several rounds of increasing the Equity Note amount to satisfy the Remaining Cash Requirement, and then increasing the Equity Note amount again for the resulting Remaining Cash Requirement. This process continues until the Remaining Cash Requirement becomes small enough to be covered by a direct Cash Contribution, effectively finishing the process.
