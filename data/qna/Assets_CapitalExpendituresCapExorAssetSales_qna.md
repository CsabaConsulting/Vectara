Question: What are Capital Expenditures?
Answer: Capital Expenditures, also known as Cap Ex, refer to purchases of assets that are not Inventory or Accounts Receivable. These expenditures are recorded as positive numbers on the Cap Ex Input page. When a capital purchase is made, the depreciation for that asset will be calculated using the factors specified on the Depreciation Set-Up page.
It is important to note that a negative number input is used to represent Asset Sales. This negative number should reflect the proceeds from the sale of the asset. In the *ThruThink* analysis, entering a negative number for an Asset Sale will reduce the Gross Value of the Asset Class and increase the Cash value.
To accurately represent an Asset Sale, multiple Adjusting Journal Entries (AJE) in Step 7 need to be made. These AJEs are necessary to record the Gain or Loss on the Sale of Assets, reduce the Accumulated Depreciation, and adjust the Asset Value to reflect the removal of the Book Value of the asset rather than the proceeds from the sale. Any gains from asset sales are considered Long Term Capital Gains if the assets were held for over one year. Capital Losses from the Sale of Assets can be carried forward to offset future Capital Gains, but they cannot be applied against Ordinary Income.
If Adjusting Journal Entries are not made to record the Gain or Loss and adjust the Accumulated Depreciation, all asset sales will be considered as net book value, and no gain or loss will be recognized until the proceeds from the Asset Sale exceed the entire value of the Asset Class.
When the proceeds from an Asset Sale exceed the Gross Value (prior to depreciation) of the Asset Class, the Asset Class value will be reduced to zero, and the Accumulated Depreciation will be recaptured and counted as Ordinary Income. The excess value from the sale will be counted as Long Term Capital Gain. Adjusting Journal Entries in Step 7 can be made to adjust the Long Term Capital Gain to Ordinary Income if necessary.
After an Asset Sale, the regular depreciation expense for the Asset Class will be reduced by an allocated amount representing the Sold Asset. The Sale Amount will be divided by the Asset Class life years, resulting in a reduction in the annual depreciation expense for the Asset Class. However, since these calculations are based on averages and not specific asset removal, the exact year of acquisition for the Sold Asset is unknown. Therefore, the specific associated depreciation for the Sold Asset should be considered approximate in nature.

Question: How are Capital Expenditures represented on the Cap Ex Input page?
Answer: On the Cap Ex Input page, Capital Expenditures are represented by a positive number. This positive number is used to indicate the amount of money spent on purchasing assets other than Inventory and Accounts Receivable. The page requires input of the positive number to reflect the purchases of these assets.

Question: How is depreciation calculated for Capital Purchases?
Answer: Depreciation for Capital Purchases is calculated using the factors specified in the Depreciation Set-Up page. The exact method of depreciation calculation is not mentioned in the given text, but it can be assumed that the system or software used for analysis provides a mechanism to input the necessary factors for depreciation calculation. These factors could include the useful life of the asset, the salvage value, and the depreciation method (such as straight-line or accelerated depreciation). The system likely applies these factors to the purchase cost of the asset to determine the annual depreciation expense. It is important to note that the text does not provide specific details on the depreciation calculation method, so it would be advisable to refer to the system's documentation or help resources for more information on how depreciation is calculated for capital purchases.

Question: How are Asset Sales represented on the Cap Ex Input page?
Answer: Asset Sales are represented on the Cap Ex Input page by entering a negative number. This negative number should represent the proceeds from the sale of the asset. In the *ThruThink* analysis, when a negative number is entered as an Asset Sale, it will reduce the Gross Value of the Asset Class and increase Cash. However, it is important to note that to fully represent the Asset Sale, multiple accounting style Adjusting Journal Entries (AJE) in Step 7 will need to be made. These AJEs will record the Gain (Loss) on Sale of Assets, reduce the Accumulated Depreciation, and adjust the Asset Value to reflect the removal of the Book Value of the asset instead of the proceeds from the sale.

Question: What happens to the Gross Value of the Asset Class when an Asset Sale is entered as a negative number?
Answer: When an Asset Sale is entered as a negative number, it will reduce the Gross Value of the Asset Class. This means that the value of the assets in the Asset Class will decrease. Additionally, the Cash balance will increase as the negative number represents the proceeds from the Asset sale. It is important to note that to fully represent the Asset Sale, multiple accounting style Adjusting Journal Entries (AJE) in Step 7 will need to be made to record the Gain (Loss) on Sale of Assets, the reduction of Accumulated Depreciation, and adjust the Asset Value to reflect the removal of the Book Value of the asset instead of the proceeds from the sale.

Question: What accounting entries need to be made to fully represent an Asset Sale?
Answer: To fully represent an Asset Sale, multiple accounting style Adjusting Journal Entries (AJE) in Step 7 will need to be made. These entries include:
1. Gain (Loss) on Sale of Assets: An AJE should be made to record the gain or loss on the sale of the asset. This entry will reflect the difference between the proceeds from the sale and the book value of the asset.
2. Reduction of Accumulated Depreciation: Another AJE should be made to reduce the accumulated depreciation associated with the sold asset. This entry will adjust the depreciation expense to reflect the removal of the asset from the books.
3. Adjustment of Asset Value: An AJE should be made to adjust the asset value to reflect the removal of the book value of the asset. This entry ensures that the asset is no longer included in the balance sheet.
By making these AJEs, the Asset Sale will be fully represented in the financial statements. It is important to note that all gains from asset sales will be considered as Long Term Capital Gains if the assets have been held for over one year. Capital losses from the sale of assets can be carried forward to offset future capital gains, but they cannot be applied against ordinary income.

Question: How are gains from asset sales classified?
Answer: Gains from asset sales are classified as Long Term Capital Gains.
---
Question: How are losses from asset sales treated?
Answer: Losses from asset sales are treated as capital losses. In the *ThruThink* analysis, when an asset sale results in a loss, it will be carried forward into future years to be applied against future capital gains. However, it is important to note that capital losses cannot be applied against ordinary income. Therefore, any capital losses from asset sales will only be used to offset future capital gains. The documentation suggests that adjusting journal entries may be made in Step 7 to adjust the long-term capital gain to ordinary income, but it does not provide specific details on how this adjustment is made.

Question: What happens if Adjusting Journal Entries are not made for an Asset Sale?
Answer: If Adjusting Journal Entries are not made for an Asset Sale, all asset sales will be considered as net book value and no gain or loss will be recognized until the Asset Sale proceeds exceed the entire Asset Class value. In other words, without the necessary journal entries, the sale of an asset will not be properly accounted for, and any gain or loss from the sale will not be recognized until the proceeds exceed the total value of the asset class. This means that the financial impact of the asset sale will not be accurately reflected in the company's books and financial statements.

Question: What happens when the proceeds from an Asset Sale exceed the Gross Value of the Asset Class?
Answer: When the proceeds from an Asset Sale exceed the Gross Value of the Asset Class, several adjustments and calculations are made. First, the Asset Class value will be reduced to zero, and the Accumulated Depreciation will be recaptured and counted as Ordinary Income. The excess value from the sale will be considered as Long Term Capital Gain.
To fully represent the Asset Sale, multiple Adjusting Journal Entries (AJE) in Step 7 will need to be made. These AJEs will record the Gain (Loss) on Sale of Assets, reduce the Accumulated Depreciation, and adjust the Asset Value to reflect the removal of the Book Value of the asset instead of the proceeds from the sale.
It is important to note that if Adjusting Journal Entries are not made to record the Gain (Loss) and adjustment to Accumulated Depreciation, all asset sales will be considered as net book value, and no gain or loss will be recognized until the Asset Sale proceeds exceed the entire Asset Class value.
In summary, when the proceeds from an Asset Sale exceed the Gross Value of the Asset Class, the Asset Class value is reduced to zero, Accumulated Depreciation is recaptured as Ordinary Income, and the excess value is considered as Long Term Capital Gain. Adjusting Journal Entries are necessary to accurately reflect these adjustments.

Question: How is depreciation expense affected in the years following an Asset Sale?
Answer: In the years following an Asset Sale, the depreciation expense will be reduced by an allocated amount representing the Sold Asset. The Sale Amount will be divided by the Asset Class life years, which will reduce the annual depreciation expense amount for the Asset Class. This means that the depreciation expense for the Asset Class (e.g., all assets booked as Machinery & Equipment) will be lower after the Asset Sale. It is important to note that these calculations are based on averages and not on the specific asset removal. Therefore, the exact year of original acquisition of the Sold Asset is unknown, and the specific associated depreciation for the Sold Asset should be considered approximate in nature.
---
Question: What should be considered about the specific associated depreciation for the Sold Asset?
Answer: The specific associated depreciation for the Sold Asset should be considered approximate in nature. This is because when an Asset Sale occurs, the regular depreciation expense for the years following the sale will be reduced by an allocated amount representing the Sold Asset. The Sale Amount will be divided by the Asset Class life years, which will reduce the annual depreciation expense amount for the Asset Class. However, since these calculations are based on averages and not the specific asset removal, the exact year of original acquisition of the Sold Asset is unknown. Therefore, the specific associated depreciation for the Sold Asset should be considered approximate.
