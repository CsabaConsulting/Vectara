Question: What is depreciation?
Answer: Depreciation refers to the process of allocating the cost of a tangible asset over its useful life, rather than expensing the entire cost in the year of purchase. In the context of the *ThruThink* analysis, depreciation is categorized into Machinery & Equipment, Buildings & Improvements, and Other Long Term Assets, each with separate life period inputs for both accrual and cash basis. The purpose of depreciation is to match the cost of the asset with the revenue it generates over its useful life. 
In the *ThruThink* analysis, each category of assets is capitalized on the balance sheet, and a separate depreciation expense is calculated for each year of the asset's life period, both for accrual and cash basis expenses. By spreading out the cost of the asset over its useful life, depreciation helps to accurately reflect the asset's value and the expenses associated with its usage.
It is important for users to consult with their tax advisors to determine the appropriate life period to use for depreciation. By default, the life period for Equipment & Machinery is set to 10 years, Buildings & Improvements is set to 20 years, and Other Long Term Assets is set to 10 years, unless changed by the user.
It is worth noting that depreciation terms only apply to the Transaction Sheet Assets and new Capital Expenditures. The depreciation expense for existing company assets is inputted by the user and is not calculated automatically.
In the case of an asset sale, the regular depreciation expense will continue for the remaining years, but it will be reduced by an allocated amount representing the sold asset. This reduction is estimated by dividing the sale amount by an estimate for the remaining life of assets in that asset class. It is important to mention that this adjustment is only an estimate and is not based on the specific removal of the sold asset, as the exact year of acquisition of the sold asset is unknown. If necessary, adjusting journal entries can be made to Accumulated Depreciation, Depreciation Expense, and Gain/Loss on Sale to make more specific adjustments.

Question: How does depreciation spread out the cost of a tangible asset?
Answer: Depreciation spreads out the cost of a tangible asset over a period of years instead of expensing the total purchase in one year. This means that instead of deducting the entire cost of the asset in the year it was purchased, the cost is allocated and deducted over the useful life of the asset. The *ThruThink* analysis provides separate categories for different types of assets, such as Machinery & Equipment, Buildings & Improvements, and Other Long Term Assets. Each category has its own life period inputs for both accrual and cash basis. The default life periods for Equipment & Machinery is 10 years, Buildings & Improvements is 20 years, and Other Long Term Assets is 10 years, unless changed by the user. 
Each year of the life period, a separate depreciation expense is calculated for both accrual and cash basis expenses. It is important for users to consult with their tax advisors to determine the proper life period to use for their assets. 
It is worth noting that depreciation terms only apply to the Transaction Sheet Assets and new Capital Expenditures. The depreciation expense for existing company assets is inputted by the user and not calculated. 
In the case of an asset sale, the regular depreciation expense will continue for the remaining years, but it will be reduced by an allocated amount representing the sold asset. The sale amount is divided by an estimate for the remaining life of assets in that asset class (e.g., Machinery & Equipment). This adjustment is only an estimate and is not based on the specific asset removal, as the exact year of acquisition of the sold asset is unknown. Users may make adjusting journal entries to Accumulated Depreciation, Depreciation Expense, and Gain/Loss on Sale to make more specific adjustments.

Question: What are the available categories for depreciation in the *ThruThink* analysis?
Answer: In the *ThruThink* analysis, there are three available categories for depreciation: Machinery & Equipment, Buildings & Improvements, and Other Long Term Assets. Each category has separate Life Period Inputs for both Accrual and Cash Basis. These categories are used to spread out the cost of tangible assets over a period of years instead of expensing the total purchase in one year. The default Life Period for Equipment & Machinery is 10 years, Buildings & Improvements is 20 years, and Other Long Term Assets is 10 years, unless changed by the user. It is important for users to consult with their Tax Advisors to determine the proper Life Period to use.

Question: What are the separate Life Period Inputs for each category?
Answer: In the *ThruThink* analysis, there are separate Life Period Inputs for each category of assets. The available categories are Machinery & Equipment, Buildings & Improvements, and Other Long Term Assets. Each category has its own Life Period Input for both Accrual and Cash Basis.
By default, unless changed by the User, the Life Period for Equipment & Machinery is 10 years, Buildings & Improvements is 20 years, and Other Long Term Assets is 10 years. These Life Period Inputs determine the period over which the cost of the assets will be spread out for depreciation purposes.
It is important for Users to consult with their Tax Advisors to determine the proper Life Period to use for each category of assets, as it may vary based on specific circumstances and regulations.
---
Question: How are the categories capitalized on the Balance Sheet?
Answer: In the *ThruThink* analysis, each category of assets, namely Machinery & Equipment, Buildings & Improvements, and Other Long Term Assets, is capitalized on the Balance Sheet. This means that the cost of these assets is recorded as an asset on the Balance Sheet rather than being expensed immediately. The purpose of capitalizing these assets is to spread out their cost over their respective life periods instead of expensing the total purchase in one year. 
It is important to note that each category has separate Life Period Inputs for both Accrual and Cash Basis. The default life periods, unless changed by the user, are 10 years for Equipment & Machinery, 20 years for Buildings & Improvements, and 10 years for Other Long Term Assets. 
Furthermore, it is mentioned that the Users should consult with their Tax Advisors for the proper Life Period to use. This suggests that the determination of the life period for each category may have tax implications, and it is advisable to seek professional advice in this regard. 
Overall, the categories of assets are capitalized on the Balance Sheet, and each year of the life period, a separate Depreciation Expense is calculated for both Accrual and Cash Basis expenses.

Question: How is depreciation expense calculated for Accrual and Cash Basis expenses?
Answer: In the *ThruThink* analysis, depreciation expense is calculated separately for Accrual and Cash Basis expenses. The calculation is based on the Life Period inputs for different categories of assets, namely Machinery & Equipment, Buildings & Improvements, and Other Long Term Assets. 
By default, unless changed by the user, the Life Period for Equipment & Machinery is set to 10 years, Buildings & Improvements is set to 20 years, and Other Long Term Assets is set to 10 years. 
Each year of the Life Period, a separate depreciation expense is calculated for both Accrual and Cash Basis expenses. The depreciation expense is spread out over the Life Period, allowing for the cost of the tangible asset to be allocated over multiple years instead of expensing the total purchase in one year. 
It is important to note that the depreciation terms only apply to the Transaction Sheet Assets and new Capital Expenditures. The Existing Company Asset Depreciation expense is inputted by the user in whole numbers and is not calculated. 
For Accrual expenses, the depreciation expense is calculated based on the Life Period inputs and is recorded as an expense on the income statement. 
For Cash Basis expenses, the depreciation expense is also calculated based on the Life Period inputs, but it is not recorded as an expense on the income statement. Instead, it is deducted from the cash flow in the period it is incurred. 
It is recommended that users consult with their Tax Advisors to determine the proper Life Period to use for depreciation calculations.

Question: How is the regular depreciation expense adjusted following an Asset Sale?
Answer: Following an Asset Sale, the regular depreciation expense is adjusted by reducing it by an allocated amount representing the Sold Asset. The Sale Amount is divided by an estimate for the remaining life for assets in that Asset Class. This adjustment reduces the annual depreciation expense amount for the Asset Class (e.g., all assets booked as Machinery & Equipment). It is important to note that this adjustment is only an estimate and is not based on the specific asset removal, as the exact year of original acquisition of the Sold Asset is unknown. If more specific adjustments are required, an Adjusting Journal Entry may be made to Accumulated Depreciation, Depreciation Expense, and Gain/Loss on Sale.

Question: How is the reduction in depreciation expense calculated for the Asset Class?
Answer: The reduction in depreciation expense for the Asset Class is calculated by dividing the Sale Amount of the sold asset by an estimate for the remaining life of assets in that Asset Class. This calculation is used to determine the amount by which the annual depreciation expense for the Asset Class should be reduced. It is important to note that this adjustment is only an estimate and is not based on the specific removal of the sold asset, as the exact year of acquisition of the sold asset is unknown. In some cases, an Adjusting Journal Entry may be made to Accumulated Depreciation, Depreciation Expense, and Gain/Loss on Sale to make more specific adjustments.
---
Question: Is the adjustment for Asset Sale based on specific asset removal?
Answer: No, the adjustment for Asset Sale is not based on specific asset removal. The exact year of original acquisition of the Sold Asset is unknown, so the adjustment is only an estimate. The Sale Amount will be divided by an estimate for the remaining life for assets in that Asset Class, which will reduce the annual depreciation expense amount for the Asset Class. This adjustment is made to account for the sale of the asset, but it is not based on the specific removal of the asset.
---
Question: What can be done to make more specific adjustments for Asset Sale?
Answer: To make more specific adjustments for Asset Sale, an Adjusting Journal Entry can be made to the following accounts: Accumulated Depreciation, Depreciation Expense, and Gain/Loss on Sale. This entry will help in accurately reflecting the impact of the asset sale on the financial statements.
The Adjusting Journal Entry should consider the sale amount of the asset and estimate the remaining life of assets in that particular asset class. The sale amount is divided by this estimated remaining life to determine the reduction in the annual depreciation expense for the asset class.
It is important to note that this adjustment is only an estimate and is not based on the specific removal of the sold asset. This is because the exact year of acquisition of the sold asset is unknown. Therefore, the adjustment is made at the asset class level rather than at the individual asset level.
By making these specific adjustments, the financial statements will provide a more accurate representation of the impact of the asset sale on the company's depreciation expense, accumulated depreciation, and gain/loss on sale.
