Question: What is the purpose of the Accounts Receivable Write Off?
Answer: The purpose of the Accounts Receivable Write Off is to remove uncollectable or unusable amounts from the Accounts Receivable and Inventory. This is done when certain Accounts Receivables or Inventories are deemed to be uncollectable or unusable. The write off amount is deducted from the Accounts Receivable and recorded as an expense at the end of the year. Some businesses may choose to have a standard allowance for write offs on an annual or multi-year basis, although this is an optional feature. The option to perform the write off can be found in the Accounts Receivable - Future Terms Set-Up Input Page.
