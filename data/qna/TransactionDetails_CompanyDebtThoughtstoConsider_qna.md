Question: What factors determine the amount of debt a company can carry?
Answer: The amount of debt a company can carry is determined by several factors, including the company's Earnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (EBITDA) and its EBITDA performance going forward. The company's net income and cash flow also play a role in determining its debt carry capacity.
If the net income is stable and growing, but the cash flow is unacceptable, adjustments can be made to the debt repayment terms, such as lengthening the time required to repay the principal or increasing the amount of cash equity (and reducing debt). Additionally, the purchase price of the company can be adjusted.
On the other hand, if the net income is insufficient and the cash flow is unacceptable, the expectations for EBITDA can be reviewed, or the entire deal structure, including the purchase price, debt structure, and equity structure, can be adjusted.
It is also mentioned that assuming the seller's debt can be a way for the buyer to provide a greater purchase price without needing additional cash or outside debt financing. However, the buyer should exercise caution and fully understand the terms, security, and obligations associated with the assumed seller debt. This debt may have onerous conditions, such as the note holder having the right to buy the company's products at a fixed price or the company being obligated to buy products from the note holder at a fixed (above market) price.

Question: What does the debt carry capacity depend on?
Answer: The debt carry capacity of a company depends on two factors: the Earnings before Interest, Taxes Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA) and the EBITDA performance of the company going forward. The amount of debt, interest rate, and repayment terms that a company can handle will be determined by its EBITDA and its projected EBITDA performance.

Question: How can the debt repayment terms be adjusted if the net income is stable but the cash flow is unacceptable?
Answer: If the net income is stable but the cash flow is unacceptable, there are several ways to adjust the debt repayment terms. One option is to lengthen the time required to repay the principal. This means extending the repayment period, which can help alleviate the immediate cash flow burden. Another option is to consider increasing the amount of cash equity in the company, which means reducing the amount of debt. This can improve the cash flow situation by reducing the interest and principal payments that need to be made. Additionally, the purchase price of the company can be adjusted to reflect the cash flow constraints. This could involve renegotiating the terms of the deal to account for the cash flow limitations and potentially reducing the purchase price. It is important to carefully evaluate these options and consider their impact on the overall financial health and obligations of the company.

Question: What can be adjusted if the net income is not sufficient and the cash flow is unacceptable?
Answer: If the net income is not sufficient and the cash flow is unacceptable, there are several adjustments that can be made. Firstly, the EBITDA expectations can be reviewed to identify areas where improvements can be made. Additionally, the entire deal structure can be adjusted, including the purchase price, debt structure, and equity structure. By reassessing these factors, it may be possible to find a more favorable arrangement that addresses the financial challenges. It is important for the buyer to carefully consider these adjustments and their potential impact on the overall financial obligations and conditions of the company.

Question: What is the assumption of seller debt?
Answer: The assumption of seller debt refers to a strategy in which the buyer of a company agrees to take on the existing debt of the seller as part of the acquisition deal. This approach allows the buyer to offer a higher purchase price to the seller without having to provide additional cash or seek external financing. However, it is important for the buyer to carefully evaluate the terms, security, and obligations associated with the seller debt. While assuming seller debt may be easier and possibly cheaper to acquire compared to external debt, there could be potential risks and onerous conditions attached to it. For example, the note holder may have the right to purchase the company's products at a fixed price or the company may be obligated to buy products from the note holder at a fixed price that is above the market rate. Therefore, buyers should exercise caution and thoroughly understand the implications of assuming seller debt before making a decision.

Question: What is the purpose of assuming seller debt?
Answer: The purpose of assuming seller debt is to provide the buyer with the opportunity to increase the purchase price without having to come up with additional cash or seek outside debt financing. By assuming the seller's debt, the buyer can potentially avoid the need for additional financial resources. However, it is important for the buyer to carefully consider the terms, security, and obligations associated with the seller debt. Assumed debt is still debt and will require repayment, although it may be easier and possibly cheaper for the buyer to acquire compared to outside debt. It is crucial for the buyer to fully understand the conditions attached to the seller debt, as it may include onerous provisions such as the note holder having the right to buy the company's products at a fixed price or obligating the company to purchase products from the note holder at a fixed price that is above the market rate. Therefore, buyers should exercise caution and thoroughly evaluate the implications of assuming seller debt.

Question: What is the difference between assumed seller debt and outside debt?
Answer: The text explains that assuming seller debt is a way for the buyer to increase the purchase price without having to provide additional cash or seek external debt financing. Assumed seller debt is still a form of debt that needs to be repaid, similar to outside debt. However, the difference lies in the potential ease and cost of acquiring assumed seller debt compared to external debt. Assumed seller debt may be easier to obtain and possibly cheaper for the buyer. 
However, the text also advises caution to the buyer when considering assumed seller debt. It is important for the buyer to fully understand the terms, security, and obligations associated with the seller debt. Assumed seller debt may come with onerous conditions, such as the note holder having the right to buy the company's products at a fixed price or obligating the company to purchase products from the note holder at a fixed (above market) price. Therefore, the buyer should be aware and exercise caution before assuming seller debt.

Question: What should the buyer be cautious about when assuming seller debt?
Answer: The buyer should exercise caution when assuming seller debt. While assuming seller debt can potentially allow for a higher purchase price and reduce the need for additional cash or outside debt financing, there are several factors that the buyer should consider:
1. Terms and Conditions: The buyer should fully understand the terms and conditions associated with the assumed seller debt. This includes repayment terms, interest rates, and any other obligations or restrictions that may be attached to the debt.
2. Security: The buyer should assess the security associated with the seller debt. This refers to any collateral or assets that may be used to secure the debt. Understanding the security can help determine the level of risk involved in assuming the debt.
3. Onerous Conditions: The buyer should be aware that the assumed seller debt may come with onerous conditions. These conditions could include provisions that give the note holder certain rights or privileges, such as the right to purchase the company's products at a fixed price or obligating the company to buy products from the note holder at a fixed (above market) price. It is important for the buyer to carefully evaluate these conditions and assess their impact on the company's operations and profitability.
4. Repayment Obligations: The buyer should recognize that assuming seller debt means taking on the responsibility for repayment. The debt will need to be repaid just like any other debt, and the buyer should ensure that they have the financial capacity to meet these repayment obligations.
5. Cost and Availability: While assuming seller debt may be easier to acquire and potentially cheaper than outside debt, the buyer should still evaluate the cost and availability of the debt. It is important to compare the terms and interest rates of the assumed seller debt with other financing options to determine the most favorable and cost-effective solution.
In summary, the buyer should exercise due diligence and thoroughly understand the terms, security, obligations, and potential risks associated with assuming seller debt. This will help the buyer make an informed decision and mitigate any potential negative consequences.
