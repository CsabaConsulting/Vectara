Question: What is the purpose of entering inventory amounts on this page?
Answer: The purpose of entering inventory amounts on this page is to record the beginning inventory for the end of the period just prior to Year 1 (the Effective Date). By entering the monthly information, it will indicate when the beginning inventory is to be used during Year 1. The inventory amounts entered will feed to either the Transaction Sheet or the Existing Company financial information, depending on the "Show On" selection, as the beginning inventory as of the Effective Date. Additionally, for every entry made on this page, the user must also enter the Sale Value of the inventory being used, which represents the value at which the inventory will be sold. The Sale Value entries on this page will flow to the Individually Scheduled Section D Income.
