Question: What knowledge is required to use the Adjusting Journal Entry provision?
Answer: To use the Adjusting Journal Entry (AJE) provision, a significant knowledge of accounting concepts is required. This includes understanding the effect of debits and credits. It is important to have a thorough understanding of how AJEs impact cash and income/expense. Additionally, familiarity with the available accounts for AJE entries is necessary, as there are limited accounts that can be used for AJE entries. It is important to review the list of available items and input the correct item number for the desired entry. It is worth noting that using the AJE function may result in unexpected outcomes or errors, as there are infinite combinations of AJE inputs and pre-checking for all possible outcomes is impossible.

Question: What should be checked when making AJEs?
Answer: When making AJEs, it is important to check the impact of the AJE by carefully reviewing the results, including the impact on cash and income/expense. This is necessary because the AJE provision is for the user's convenience, and there are infinite combinations of AJE inputs. Pre-checking for all possible outcomes becomes impossible, which means unexpected outcomes or errors could possibly occur when using the AJE function. Additionally, it is crucial to ensure that all AJEs are entered in month 12 of the applicable year. Furthermore, it is essential to review the list of available accounts for an AJE entry, which can be found on the bottom portion of the AJE Input page. Each entry in the input area for each year will directly affect cash. It is important to insert the correct positive or negative numbers to accurately reflect the desired adjustments. Any entry without an Item # listed will create an error in the analysis.

Question: What is the purpose of the AJE provision in this analysis?
Answer: The purpose of the AJE provision in this analysis is to allow users to make Adjusting Journal Entries (AJEs) to adjust various financial accounts. AJEs are used to correct errors, allocate expenses or income, and make other necessary adjustments to ensure accurate financial reporting. The provision provides a convenient way for users to input AJEs and see the impact on cash and income/expense. However, it is important to note that using the AJE function requires a significant knowledge of accounting concepts, as the effect of debits and credits must be understood. Additionally, it is mentioned that there are limitations to the available accounts for AJE entries, and any entry without an item number listed will result in an error.

Question: When do all Adjusting Journal entries occur?
Answer: All Adjusting Journal entries occur in month 12 of the applicable year.
---
Question: What will happen if an entry is made without an Item # listed?
Answer: If an entry is made without an Item # listed, it will create an error in the analysis.

Question: How should assets be adjusted?
Answer: To adjust assets, a negative number should be inserted, indicating a reduction in the asset. This assumes that the asset was liquidated for cash. If no cash was collected or there was a difference between the asset reduction and cash collected (gain or loss), a corresponding number should be inserted as an Income or Expense entry. This will adjust cash and income or expense for the gain or loss. A positive number should be used for an Expense (loss), and a negative number should be used for Income (gain). 
If a depreciable asset account is being adjusted, it is assumed that the asset was adjusted at the beginning of the year. The annual depreciation expense for that year will be adjusted based on the percentage of the asset being adjusted to total assets. This adjustment will also affect net income and income taxes accordingly.
When an asset is purchased, the Capital Expenditures Input page should be used to input the purchase. If an asset is sold, an Adjusting Journal Entry (AJE) may be used to reduce the original cost of the asset (using a negative number). If the sale price is larger than the cost (prior to depreciation), the difference between the sale price and the cost should be entered as a negative number as Income. If the sale price is less than the cost, a positive number should be entered as an Expense. The accumulated depreciation will be adjusted proportionately based on the percentage that the item cost is to the total cost. However, please note that the calculations cannot anticipate variations in the period the asset was placed in service or removed, as asset purchases may be entered by the user in varying periods.
In summary, to adjust assets:
1. Insert a negative number for a reduction in the asset.
2. Insert a corresponding number as an Income or Expense entry to adjust cash and income or expense for any gain or loss.
3. Use a positive number for an Expense (loss) and a negative number for Income (gain).
4. Adjustments to depreciable assets will affect annual depreciation expense, net income, and income taxes.
5. Use the Capital Expenditures Input page for asset purchases and AJEs for asset sales.

Question: How should depreciable asset accounts be adjusted?
Answer: Depreciable asset accounts should be adjusted by inserting a negative number to reduce the asset. This adjustment assumes that the asset was liquidated for cash. If no cash was collected or there was a difference between the asset reduction and cash collected (gain or loss), a corresponding number should be inserted as an Income or Expense. This will adjust cash and income or expense for the gain or loss. 
Additionally, when adjusting a depreciable asset account, it is assumed that the asset was adjusted at the beginning of the year. The annual depreciation expense for that year will be adjusted in proportion to the percentage of the asset being adjusted to total assets. As a result, net income and income taxes will change accordingly. 
It is important to note that the calculations cannot anticipate variations in the period the asset was placed in service or removed. Therefore, the accumulated depreciation will be adjusted proportionately based on the percentage that the item cost is to the total cost. The annual depreciation will be adjusted upward if the asset was purchased during the period and downward if the asset was removed during the period.

Question: How should assets be adjusted when they are purchased or sold?
Answer: When adjusting assets, there are specific guidelines to follow depending on whether the asset is being purchased or sold. 
1. Purchasing an Asset: 
   - Use the Capital Expenditures Input page to input the purchase of the asset.
   - Insert a positive number to increase the specific balance sheet account, reduce or use cash (which will reduce equity), and have no effect on income or expense.
   - The annual depreciation expense for that year will be adjusted based on the percentage of the asset being adjusted to total assets, and net income and income taxes will change accordingly.
2. Selling an Asset:
   - An AJE may be used to reduce the original cost of the asset by inserting a negative number.
   - If the sale price is larger than the cost (prior to depreciation), insert the difference between the sale price and the cost as a negative number as income.
   - If the sale price is less than the cost, insert the difference as a positive number as an expense.
   - The accumulated depreciation will be adjusted proportionately to the percentage that the item cost is to the total cost.
   - The annual depreciation will be adjusted upward if the asset was purchased during the period and downward if the asset was removed during the period.
It is important to note that these adjustments are approximations, as the actual period the asset was placed in service is not available in the calculations. Additionally, the AJE provision is for the user's convenience, but unexpected outcomes or errors could occur when using the AJE function.

Question: How should liabilities be adjusted?
Answer: To adjust liabilities, you should enter a positive number for a reduction of the liability. If the effect on cash is not the same as the change in the liability, you should insert a corresponding number as an Income or Expense. Use a positive number for an Expense (loss) and a negative number for Income (gain). For example, if you want to write off a liability of $500,000, you should insert 500,000 for the liability and -500,000 for Income.
---
Question: How should income or expense adjustments be made?
Answer: To make income or expense adjustments, you should follow the guidelines provided in the documentation. 
First, identify the balance sheet item that needs adjustment. Then, make a corresponding entry with the item number for income or expense using the opposite sign from the balance sheet item adjustment. 
For example, if you need to adjust an expense, you would make an AJE to general Income/Expense. This adjustment will show up as a debit or positive number for an expense or a credit or negative number for income adjustment to Other Income - Expense on the Income Statement. 
It's important to note that any change in income or expense through an AJE without a corresponding opposite entry will have a direct offset to cash in the current year. 
Additionally, income taxes are calculated on the accrual basis and are an expense in the year they are incurred and paid with estimated taxes during the taxable year. If there is a change to income tax expense through an AJE without a corresponding opposite entry, it will have a direct offset to cash in the current year. 
When using income or expense AJEs, if an offset to A/P or Accrued Interest is used along with it, on the cash basis, there will be no cash or tax effect. On the accrual basis, taxes will be adjusted, and the cash will be adjusted by the net after-tax effect. 
Overall, it is important to carefully follow the instructions provided in the documentation to ensure accurate income or expense adjustments.

Question: What is the effect of an AJE to income or expense without a corresponding opposite entry?
Answer: The effect of an AJE to income or expense without a corresponding opposite entry is a direct offset to cash in the current year. This means that the cash balance will be directly affected by the adjustment made to income or expense through the AJE.
---
Question: How are income taxes calculated and when are they finalized?
Answer: Income taxes are calculated on the accrual basis and are considered an expense in the year they are incurred. They are paid with estimated taxes during the taxable year and finalized in Period 4 of the following year. This means that income taxes are estimated and paid throughout the year based on the expected tax liability. However, the final calculation and adjustment of income taxes occur in Period 4 of the following year. This allows for any necessary adjustments to be made based on the actual income and expenses incurred during the year.
---
Question: What is the effect of an AJE to income tax expense without a corresponding opposite entry?
Answer: The effect of an AJE to income tax expense without a corresponding opposite entry is a direct offset to cash in the current year. This means that the cash balance will be adjusted accordingly based on the AJE made to income tax expense.
---
Question: What happens when using Income or Expense AJEs with an offset to A/P or Accrued Interest?
Answer: When using Income or Expense AJEs with an offset to A/P or Accrued Interest, the effect will depend on whether the accounting is done on a cash basis or an accrual basis.
On a cash basis, there will be no cash or tax effect when using an offset to A/P or Accrued Interest along with Income or Expense AJEs.
On an accrual basis, taxes will be adjusted and the cash will be adjusted by the net after-tax effect. In this case, when using Income or Expense AJEs without another balance sheet account, it is considered a cash transaction. The offset will be the tax expense, and the net cash will be adjusted for both Cash and Accrual basis.
In summary, when using Income or Expense AJEs with an offset to A/P or Accrued Interest, the impact will vary depending on the accounting basis used.

Question: What is not allowed when making an AJE to a loan?
Answer: When making an AJE to a loan, it is not allowed to make the loan balance become negative (debit balance).
---
Question: What happens to the loan balance when an AJE is made to a Specifically Scheduled Note Receivable or Loan?
Answer: When an AJE is made to a Specifically Scheduled Note Receivable or Loan during the term of the note or loan, the resulting note or loan balance will continue to be collected or paid down with the same payments identified in the note or loan set up table. Any remaining principal outstanding at the end of the term will be automatically collected or paid in the final term. However, it is important to note that an AJE is not allowed to be made before a Scheduled Item is set to begin or on or after the year it is scheduled to be paid off. 
For Interest only types of Notes or Loans (#0 or #3 type), the AJE amount will create a new balance and the interest will be automatically received or paid at the rate for the original note or loan. A subsequent AJE will then need to be made to reduce the principal balance. 
For an amortized or principal plus interest note receivable or loan (#1 or #2 type), an AJE made after the original term is expired will be automatically collected or paid off in the next period including interest for that period.
---
Question: What happens to the remaining principal outstanding at the end of the term of a note or loan?
Answer: If there is any remaining principal outstanding at the end of the term of a note or loan, it will be automatically collected or paid in the final term. This means that the borrower will be required to make a final payment to fully repay the remaining principal balance.
---
Question: What happens when making an AJE to an Interest only type of Note or Loan?
Answer: When making an AJE to an interest-only type of note or loan, the AJE amount will create a new balance. The interest will be automatically received or paid at the rate for the original note or loan. However, a subsequent AJE will then need to be made to reduce the principal balance. It is important to note that an AJE is not allowed to be made before a scheduled item is set to begin or on or after the year it is scheduled to be paid off.
---
Question: What happens when making an AJE to an amortized or principal plus interest note receivable or loan?
Answer: When making an AJE to an amortized or principal plus interest note receivable or loan, the AJE made after the original term is expired will be automatically collected or paid off in the next period, including interest for that period. This means that any adjustments made to the note receivable or loan balance will be reflected in the next payment period. The interest for that period will also be adjusted accordingly.
---
Question: What are non cash items that AJEs can be made to?
Answer: AJEs can be made to a (Gain) Loss on Sale account, which is a non cash item. This is mainly used to adjust for a non cash loss on the sale of assets. It is important to note that actual gains from the sale of assets, which are cash items, should be made to Other Income/Expense.
---
Question: How are non expense cash flow AJE items accounted for?
Answer: Non expense cash flow AJE items are accounted for by being collected in total and flowing to the Cash Flow Control and Sources and Uses of Cash as Non Expense Cash Flow AJE Items in Total. These items are summarized at the bottom of the Summary AJE Input page. This means that they are not allocated to individual accounts like income and expense AJE items. Instead, they are treated as a collective total and included in the overall cash flow analysis.
