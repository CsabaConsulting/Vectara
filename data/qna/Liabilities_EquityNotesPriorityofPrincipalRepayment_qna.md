Question: What is the priority order for applying extra payments to the Equity Note?
Answer: The priority order for applying extra payments to the Equity Note is as follows:
1. Accrued interest on Current Input Equity Debt
2. Principal on Equity debt
3. Accrued interest on any Combined Multiple Projects Equity debt
4. Principal on the Combined Multiple Projects Equity debt
This means that when there is extra cash available to be applied to the Equity Note, it will first be used to pay off any accrued interest on the Current Input Equity Debt. Once the accrued interest is fully paid, the remaining amount will be applied towards the principal on the Equity debt. After that, any additional extra payments will be used to pay off accrued interest on any Combined Multiple Projects Equity debt, followed by the principal on the Combined Multiple Projects Equity debt.
