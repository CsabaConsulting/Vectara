Question: What is the difference between the Accrual Basis method and the Cash Basis method of accounting?
Answer: The Accrual Basis method of accounting recognizes income in the month a sale or income is made and expenses in the month the expense is incurred. On the other hand, the Cash Basis method of accounting recognizes income and expenses in the month that it was received and/or paid. 
This means that the Accrual Basis method focuses on when the transaction occurs, regardless of when the cash is actually received or paid. It provides a more accurate representation of the financial performance of a business as it matches revenues with the expenses incurred to generate those revenues.
In contrast, the Cash Basis method only considers the actual cash inflows and outflows, without considering when the underlying transactions occurred. It is simpler and easier to understand, but it may not provide an accurate picture of the financial performance since it does not account for transactions that have been made but not yet paid or received.
In summary, the main difference between the Accrual Basis method and the Cash Basis method is the timing of when income and expenses are recognized. The Accrual Basis method focuses on when the transaction occurs, while the Cash Basis method focuses on when the cash is received or paid.

Question: When is inventory expensed?
Answer: Inventory is expensed when it is used. This means that the cost of inventory is recognized as an expense in the month that it is consumed or sold. This is in contrast to the Cash Basis method of accounting, where expenses are recognized in the month they are paid. The Accrual Basis method, which recognizes income and expenses in the month they are earned or incurred, is generally considered the most accurate way to assess the financial performance of a business.

Answer: The default inputs applied to the annual accrual income and expense amounts entered are as follows:
1. Weeks for Collection for Accounts Receivable: This input determines the average time it takes for the business to collect payments from customers. It is used to calculate the Accounts Receivable balance.
2. Days for Payment for Accounts Payable: This input represents the average time it takes for the business to make payments to suppliers or vendors. It is used to calculate the Accounts Payable balance.
3. Weeks of Inventory: This input determines the average number of weeks of inventory the business holds. It is used to calculate the Inventory balance.
These default inputs are automatically applied to the annual accrual income and expense amounts entered by the user. However, the user has the flexibility to adjust these inputs to customize the Accounts Receivable, Accounts Payable, and Inventory balances according to their specific business needs.

Answer: Yes, the user can indicate if taxes should be paid on an Accrual or Cash basis. If the user selects Cash Basis for taxes, the Income Statement will still be on an accrual basis with accrual-based taxes as an expense. However, the cash flow will reflect the Cash Basis tax payments.
