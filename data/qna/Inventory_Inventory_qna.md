Question: What is included in inventory?
Answer: Inventory includes unused material and supplies used to create finished products, as well as unsold finished products. It also includes work in process, which consists of allocated manufacturing labor, direct materials, and supplies of unfinished finished products. Unsold completed finished product inventory includes allocated direct manufacturing labor, as well as direct materials and supplies. Cash paid to create inventory or user capitalized expenses are counted as inventory assets and not as expenses in the accounting methods.

Question: How can the user specify how much inventory should be replenished and how long it should take?
Answer: The user can specify the amount of inventory to be replenished and the time it should take by using the "Inventory Replenish" feature. This feature allows the user to determine the amount of inventory that should be replenished in the next year and the number of weeks it should take to replenish it. 
To specify the replenishment amount, the user can enter the desired quantity in the designated input field. The replenishment amount is in addition to the normal amount of inventory being generated for the current year's sales.
To determine the time it should take to replenish the inventory, the user can enter a whole number between 0 and 52 in the "Weeks to replenish" input field. It is important to note that specific calculations are only made for years 1-3, and week-to-week calculations are only made for those years as well.
It is worth mentioning that the greater the amount to replenish and the shorter the desired time, the greater the impact on cash flow requirements, as it will put a greater demand on cash flow.

Question: What is the impact on cash flow when there is a greater amount to replenish and a shorter time desired?
Answer: When there is a greater amount to replenish and a shorter time desired, it has a significant impact on cash flow requirements. This means that more cash will be needed to meet the increased demand for inventory replenishment within a shorter timeframe. The greater amount to replenish implies that a larger quantity of inventory needs to be purchased or produced, which requires more cash outflow. Additionally, the shorter time desired for replenishment means that the cash outflow needs to be accelerated to meet the deadline. Therefore, the combination of a greater amount to replenish and a shorter time desired puts a greater strain on cash flow and requires careful management of available funds to ensure sufficient liquidity.

Question: When is the cost of an item put into inventory as an asset?
Answer: The cost of an item is put into inventory as an asset when the item is manufactured or purchased for resale.

Question: What happens to the cost of an item when it is sold?
Answer: When an item is sold, the cost of the item is taken out of inventory and expensed as a part of Cost of Goods Sold (COGS). This means that the cost of the item is no longer considered an asset but is instead recognized as an expense. However, it is important to note that the total COGS for the item sold may also include other costs incurred at the time of sale, such as packaging and shipping. The percentage of COGS to be inventoried refers to the percentage of the total COGS that are expenses purchased for inventory to be used at a later date.

Question: What other costs are included in the total COGS for an item sold?
Answer: The other costs included in the total Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) for an item sold are expenses incurred at the time of sale, such as packaging and shipping. These costs are in addition to the cost of the item itself and any other expenses that were incurred to acquire or produce the item and are considered part of the overall cost of selling the item.
