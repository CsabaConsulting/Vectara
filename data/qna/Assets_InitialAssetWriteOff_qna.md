Question: What is the purpose of the Initial Asset Write Off provision?
Answer: The purpose of the Initial Asset Write Off provision is to allow the buyer of a company to write off a percentage of the initial asset value being paid to the seller. This provision is intended to address any doubts or concerns the buyer may have about the value of the asset at the time of purchase or analysis. By writing off a portion of the initial value, the buyer can reflect any confidence issues with the asset. It is important to note that the write off does not change the purchase price paid to the seller, but rather reduces the initial value of the asset by the specified percentage. The value after the write off will then flow into the post-closing balance sheet. This provision is available on the Transaction Sheet Asset Input page for major asset categories and is typically found in Step 5 of the process.
