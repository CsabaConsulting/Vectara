Question: How is the Debt Service Coverage (DSC) Ratio calculated in ThruThink?
Answer: In ThruThink, the Debt Service Coverage (DSC) Ratio is calculated by dividing the Earnings before Interest, Income Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA) from the business by the Total Interest Expense plus Principal payments on Long Term Debt. This calculation is used to determine how normal earnings from the business can cover the debt payments. The DSC Ratio is expressed as a ratio and a common target for this calculation is 1.25:1. 
Additionally, ThruThink also calculates the Debt Service Coverage as Cash Available for Debt Service on a Trailing Twelve Month (TTM) basis. This calculation takes into account the TTM EBITDA less the TTM Non Financed Capital Expenditures plus the TTM Capital Contributions and less the TTM Capital Draws. This result is then divided by the Total TTM Interest Expense plus TTM Principal Payments on Long Term Debt. This calculation is often used by lenders as a loan covenant and the goal for this ratio is also 1.25:1.
To view the Trailing Twelve Month Debt Service (TTM DSC) calculation for Year 1, the user can enter a blank as the current month on the Projection to Actual Comparison Page in the Information Browser.

Question: What is the purpose of the TTM DSC calculation?
Answer: The purpose of the Trailing Twelve Month (TTM) Debt Service Coverage (DSC) calculation is to assess the ability of a business to generate enough earnings to cover its debt payments over a twelve-month period. It is a ratio that indicates the extent to which the normal earnings from the business can meet the financial obligations related to debt.
By calculating the TTM DSC, lenders and financial analysts can evaluate the financial health and stability of a company. It helps them determine if the business has sufficient cash flow to comfortably make interest payments and repay the principal amount on its long-term debt.
The TTM DSC calculation takes into account various financial factors such as Earnings before Interest, Income Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA), Total Interest Expense, Principal payments on Long Term Debt, Non Financed Capital Expenditures, Capital Contributions, and Capital Draws. By considering these elements, the TTM DSC provides a comprehensive view of the company's ability to service its debt obligations.
A common target for the TTM DSC ratio is 1.25:1, meaning that the business should generate earnings that are 1.25 times greater than its debt payments. This ratio is often used as a loan covenant by lenders to ensure that the borrower has a sufficient margin of safety to meet its financial obligations.
