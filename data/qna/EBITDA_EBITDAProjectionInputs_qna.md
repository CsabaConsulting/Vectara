Question: What happens if a direct input for EBITDA is used?
Answer: If a direct input for EBITDA is used, it will override all results from Sales less COGS and Operating Expenses. This means that all sales, COGS, and Operating Expenses will be ignored or zeroed out. However, manually inputted Operating Expense adjustments, Seller Lease Expense, and Other (Income) Expense will not be overridden by the EBITDA input. It is important to note that completing the Base EBITDA input in Step 3 is still necessary as that information will be used as part of the Deal Evaluation process.

Question: What inputs will be ignored if a direct input for EBITDA is used?
Answer: If a direct input for EBITDA is used, all sales, COGS (Cost of Goods Sold), and operating expenses will be ignored or zeroed out. Additionally, any inputs in the Individually Scheduled Sales Input page will also be ignored. However, manually inputted operating expense adjustments, seller lease expense, and other income expense will not be overridden by the EBITDA override inputs.

Question: What inputs will not be overridden by EBITDA override inputs?
Answer: The inputs that will not be overridden by EBITDA override inputs are:
- Manually inputted Operating Expense adjustments
- Seller Lease Expense
- Other (Income) Expense

Question: Why is it important to complete the Base EBITDA input in Step 3?
Answer: It is important to complete the Base EBITDA input in Step 3 because this information will be used as part of the Deal Evaluation process. The Base EBITDA serves as a reference point for evaluating the financial performance of the company. It is used to calculate the projected EBITDA for the Horizon Period, which is the period for which the user can enter EBITDA projections.
Completing the Base EBITDA input accurately in Step 3 ensures that the projected EBITDA calculations are based on a reliable starting point. This helps in making informed decisions and evaluating the financial feasibility of the deal.

Question: How can EBITDA for the Horizon Period be entered by the user?
Answer: EBITDA for the Horizon Period can be entered by the user in three different ways:
1. Percent Increase: The user can enter a percentage increase over the beginning or previous year's EBITDA in Step 3. This means that the EBITDA for each subsequent year will be calculated by applying the specified percentage increase to the starting or previous year's EBITDA.
2. Cash Flow Control Page Override Adjustment (Percentage Increase): The user can override the EBITDA inputs by entering a percentage increase over the beginning or previous year's EBITDA on the Cash Flow Control page. This input will override the percentage inputs specified in Step 3.
3. Cash Flow Control Page Override Adjustment (Whole Number): The user can also override the EBITDA inputs by entering a whole number on the Cash Flow Control page. This whole number input will override both the percentage inputs specified in Step 3 and the percentage inputs on the Cash Flow Control page.
It is important to note that when an EBITDA override is used, certain balances such as Accounts Receivable (A/R) and Inventory will either decrease by the specified write-off amount each year or remain constant from year to year. Accounts Payable (A/P), on the other hand, will stay constant from year to year when an EBITDA override is used.
Additionally, when the Existing Company is being purchased or purchasing the Target Company, EBITDA inputs from both the Transaction Sheet and the Existing Company will be combined. Care should be taken to avoid duplicating amounts. If EBITDA growth inputs are made for both the Target Company and the Existing Company, the calculations can be kept separate on the Cash Flow Control page. However, if there is a break in the annual growth inputs or no percentage is entered for Year 1 or after Year 1, subsequent percent growth entries after the break will be ignored.
To maintain the same EBITDA number as the prior year and avoid a break, a "0" can be entered for no growth. If a break occurs, the Transaction Sheet EBITDA and the Existing Company EBITDA will be combined, and subsequent separate EBITDA growth inputs by Target Company or Existing Company will be ignored. Adjustments can then be made using the whole number or percentage EBITDA inputs to adjust the total EBITDA.

Question: How does an EBITDA override affect the balances of Accounts Receivable (A/R) and Inventory?
Answer: When an EBITDA override is used, the balances of Accounts Receivable (A/R) and Inventory will be affected in the following way:
1. If there are beginning A/R and Inventory balances, these same balances will be used at the end of all subsequent years.
2. A/R and Inventory will decrease by the amount set to write off each year, unless specified otherwise.
3. If no write-off amount is set, A/R and Inventory will remain constant from year to year.
In summary, an EBITDA override does not directly impact the balances of A/R and Inventory. Instead, it determines the write-off amount for each year, which can result in a decrease in these balances over time.
---
Question: How does an EBITDA override affect the balance of Accounts Payable (A/P)?
Answer: When an EBITDA override is used, the balance of Accounts Payable (A/P) will stay constant from year to year. This means that if there is a beginning A/P balance, it will remain the same throughout all subsequent years, regardless of any changes in EBITDA. The EBITDA override does not affect the balance of A/P.

Question: What happens when the Existing Company is being purchased or purchasing the Target Company?
Answer: When the Existing Company is being purchased or purchasing the Target Company, the EBITDA inputs from both the Transaction Sheet and the Existing Company will be combined. However, care should be taken to avoid duplicating amounts. 
If EBITDA growth inputs are made for both the Existing Company and the Target Company, the EBITDA calculations can be kept separate on the Cash Flow Control page. However, if there is a break in the annual growth inputs (no input or by using Sales less, expense method or using a Whole Number override) after Year 1, any subsequent percent growth entries after the break on the Cash Flow Control page will be ignored.
To avoid a break and maintain the same EBITDA number as the prior year, a "0" can be entered for no growth. This will be considered an input and prevent a break in the EBITDA calculations.
Once the Transaction EBITDA and the Existing Company EBITDA become combined, the subsequent separation becomes unavailable, and the subsequent separate EBITDA growth inputs by Target Company or Existing Company will be ignored. Adjustments are then made using the Whole Number or percent EBITDA inputs that will adjust the total EBITDA.

Question: How can EBITDA calculations be kept separate on the Cash Flow Control page when the Existing Company is being purchased or purchasing the Target Company?
Answer: When the Existing Company is being purchased or purchasing the Target Company, EBITDA calculations can be kept separate on the Cash Flow Control page. This can be achieved by entering percent growth inputs for EBITDA for each company separately. 
If no percent growth is entered for Year 1 or after a certain year, and there is a break in the annual growth inputs (either no input or by using the Sales less expense method or a Whole Number override), any subsequent percent growth entries after the break on the Cash Flow Control page will be ignored.
To avoid a break and maintain separate EBITDA calculations, a "0" can be entered for no growth, which will be considered an input and maintain the same EBITDA number as the prior year.
However, it is important to note that if a break occurs, the EBITDA inputs from both the Transaction Sheet and the Existing Company will be combined. Once the Transaction EBITDA and the Existing Company EBITDA are combined, the subsequent separation of EBITDA growth inputs by Target Company or Existing Company will be ignored. Adjustments will then be made using the Whole Number or percent EBITDA inputs to adjust the total EBITDA.
---
Question: What happens if there is a break in the annual growth inputs after Year 1?
Answer: If there is a break in the annual growth inputs after Year 1, any subsequent percent growth entries on the Cash Flow Control page will be ignored. This means that if no percent growth is entered for Year 1 or after Year 1, and there is a break in the annual growth inputs (either no input or by using the Sales less expense method or a Whole Number override), any percent growth entries made after the break will not be considered.
In other words, if there is a break in the growth inputs, the EBITDA calculations for the Target Company or Existing Company will no longer be separate. The EBITDA inputs from both the Transaction Sheet and the Existing Company will be combined. Once the Transaction EBITDA and the Existing Company EBITDA are combined, any subsequent separate EBITDA growth inputs for the Target Company or Existing Company will be ignored.
Instead, adjustments to the Total EBITDA will be made using the Whole Number or percent EBITDA inputs, which will adjust the overall EBITDA projection.
---
Question: How can a "0" be used to indicate no growth?
Answer: To indicate no growth, a "0" can be entered as an input. In the context of EBITDA projections, if no growth is desired, entering a "0" will be considered as an input and will maintain the same EBITDA number as the prior year. This means that the EBITDA value will remain constant without any increase or decrease.
---
Question: What happens when the Transaction EBITDA and the Existing Company EBITDA become combined?
Answer: When the Transaction EBITDA and the Existing Company EBITDA become combined, any subsequent separate EBITDA growth inputs by Target Company or Existing Company will be ignored. Adjustments to the Total EBITDA will then be made using the Whole Number or % EBITDA inputs. In other words, once the Transaction EBITDA and the Existing Company EBITDA are combined, the ability to separately adjust the EBITDA growth for each company is no longer available.
---
Question: What inputs are used to adjust the Total EBITDA in that case?
Answer: In the given scenario, the inputs used to adjust the Total EBITDA are the Whole Number or % EBITDA Inputs. These inputs are entered on the Cash Flow Control page as override adjustments. 
If a Whole Number input is used for EBITDA on the Cash Flow Control form, it will override both the % inputs entered in Step 3 and the Cash Flow Control % EBITDA inputs. This means that the Whole Number input will directly adjust the Total EBITDA.
Similarly, if a Percent Increase input is entered for EBITDA on the Cash Flow Control page, it will override the % inputs entered in Step 3. This Percent Increase will be applied to the beginning or previous year's EBITDA to calculate the adjusted EBITDA for the horizon period.
It is important to note that when an EBITDA override is used, the beginning Accounts Receivable (A/R) and Inventory balances will be used at the end of all subsequent years. A/R and Inventory will decrease by the specified write-off amount each year or remain constant if no write-off is specified. Additionally, if there is beginning Accounts Payable (A/P), A/P will stay constant from year to year.
