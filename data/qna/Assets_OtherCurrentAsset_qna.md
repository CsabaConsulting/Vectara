Question: What are the two methods for reporting Other Current Asset?
Answer: The two methods for reporting Other Current Asset are:
1) General category: Other Current Asset can be reported as a general category on the Transaction Sheet and the Existing Company asset input forms. This category is used for reporting general miscellaneous assets due within 12 months. It is non-interest bearing and can only be adjusted in future years through the adjustment on the Cash Flow Control or an Adjusting Journal Entry.
2) Individually Scheduled: More detailed information, including interest rate and payment timing, can be reported on the Individually Scheduled Other Current Asset input forms. This method is used for reporting interest-bearing items that are collected in specific months of the next fiscal year period, unless annually renewed. It is generally used for short-term investments to be collected within 12 months. The Individual Scheduled Items can be applied to either the Transaction Sheet for the Target Company or directly to the Existing Company during the beginning asset setup. The month selection only applies during years 1-3.

Question: What happens if "Yes" is selected in the Annual Renewal Box for the Other Current Asset balance?
Answer: If "Yes" is selected in the Annual Renewal Box for the Other Current Asset balance, it means that the balance of the Other Current Asset will be renewed each year of the Horizon Period and will not be automatically received. This renewal applies to both the general category of Other Current Asset on the Transaction Sheet and the Individually Scheduled Other Current Asset amounts.
By selecting "Yes" in the Annual Renewal Box on the Current Asset Balance Detail page for any of the years, the Other Current Asset balance will be renewed and will not be automatically received in the renewal year selected. However, it will still be considered a short-term asset that is due within 12 months.
It is important to note that the annual renewal selections made on the Current Asset Balance Detail page will override the selection made on the Transaction Sheet. So, if "Yes" is selected for renewal on the Current Asset Balance Detail page, it will apply to both the general category and the individually scheduled items.
It is also worth mentioning that the renewal option only affects the interest-bearing portion of the Other Current Asset. The non-interest-bearing portion is automatically renewed until adjusted with an Adjusting Journal Entry (AJE).
If only a portion of the Other Current Asset is to be renewed, the user can manually make a payment on the non-renewed portion using the Cash Flow Control page.
Overall, selecting "Yes" in the Annual Renewal Box ensures that the Other Current Asset balance is renewed each year, maintaining its status as a short-term asset due within 12 months.

Answer: Annual renewals for the Other Current Asset balance are made on the Other Current Asset Balance Detail page. On this page, the user can select "Yes" in the Annual Renewal Box for any of the years to renew the Other Current Asset balance. This selection will override the selection made on the Transaction Sheet. By selecting "Yes" for annual renewal, the Other Current Asset balance will be renewed each year of the Horizon Period and will not be automatically received. It is important to note that turning renewals on or off will only affect the Interest Bearing Portion of the Other Current Asset, as the Non-Interest Portion is automatically renewed until adjusted with an Adjusting Journal Entry (AJE).
---
Question: What happens if only a portion of the Other Current Asset is to be renewed?
Answer: If only a portion of the Other Current Asset is to be renewed, the user can make a manual payment on the Other Current Asset using the Cash Flow Control page for that portion of the asset that is not renewed. This means that the user can choose to renew only a specific portion of the asset while allowing the remaining portion to expire or be collected at the end of the indicated year. The renewal process will still apply to the renewed portion, and it will be considered a short-term asset due within 12 months.

Question: What is the purpose of Adjusting Journal Entries (AJE)?
Answer: The purpose of Adjusting Journal Entries (AJE) is to make changes or adjustments to the General Other Current Asset category. AJEs only affect the general category of Other Current Asset and do not impact the Individually Scheduled Other Current Asset amounts. These entries are made at the end of the year and have a direct effect on cash but do not impact income/expenses or tax calculations, whether on a cash basis or accrual basis. It is important for the user to be cautious when making AJEs to ensure that the intended cash effect is achieved. If necessary, an AJE to another account with the opposite sign may need to be made to offset the cash effect. The cash flow impact of an AJE to Other Current Asset will be reflected in the Non-Expense Adjusting Journal Entry cash flow line item in the Cash Flow Control form.

If necessary, an AJE to another account with the opposite sign may need to be made to offset the cash effect.
