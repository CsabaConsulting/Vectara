Question: What is the purpose of the "Additional Funds Required" amount shown on the Transaction Sheet Deal Structure?
Answer: The purpose of the "Additional Funds Required" amount shown on the Transaction Sheet Deal Structure is to indicate the amount of capital that is needed beyond what is provided by the Transaction Deal Structure through Debt or Equity. This amount represents the additional funds that are required to meet the financial needs of the transaction. 
If the Equity holders in the Deal own 100% of the equity of the post-closing company, the additional funds required will be treated as assumed equity provided and will be shown in a separate line of the Equity Section of the Balance Sheet as "Additional Funds Required". This means that the additional funds will be accounted for as equity in the post-closing company.
However, if the Equity holders in the Deal are not purchasing 100% of the equity of the post-closing company, the additional funds required will not be included in the Equity Section of the Balance Sheet. In this case, the post-closing Balance Sheet represents 100% of the company, and the transaction between the old equity holders and the new equity holders will occur outside the company's post-closing balance sheet. Therefore, the "Additional Funds Required" amount is provided for informational purposes only in this scenario.

Question: What happens to the additional funds required if the Equity holders in the Deal are not purchasing 100% of the equity of the post closing company?
Answer: If the Equity holders in the Deal are not purchasing 100% of the equity of the post closing company, the additional funds required will not flow to the Equity Section of the Balance Sheet. This is because the post closing Balance Sheet represents 100% of the Company. In this case, the Deal Transaction is between the old equity holders and the new equity holders and will occur outside the Company's post closing balance sheet. Therefore, the "Additional Funds Required" is only for information purposes and will not be reflected in the Equity Section of the Balance Sheet.

Question: In this case, where does the Deal Transaction occur?
Answer: In the given scenario, where the equity holders in the deal are not purchasing 100% of the equity of the post-closing company, the Deal Transaction will occur outside the company's post-closing balance sheet. This means that the transaction will take place between the old equity holders and the new equity holders, separate from the company's financial statements. The "Additional Funds Required" amount, in this case, is only provided for information purposes and will not flow to the Equity Section of the Balance Sheet.

Question: Is the "Additional Funds Required" amount included in the post closing Balance Sheet if the purchase is less than 100% of the Company?
Answer: No, if the purchase is less than 100% of the Company, the "Additional Funds Required" amount is not included in the post closing Balance Sheet. The post closing Balance Sheet represents 100% of the Company, so any additional funds required in this scenario will not flow to the Equity Section of the Balance Sheet. Instead, the Deal Transaction between the old equity holders and the new equity holders will occur outside the Company's post closing balance sheet. Therefore, the "Additional Funds Required" amount is only for information purposes in this case.

Question: What is the purpose of including the "Additional Funds Required" in this scenario?
Answer: The purpose of including the "Additional Funds Required" in this scenario is to indicate the amount of capital that is needed beyond what is provided by the Transaction Deal Structure. This amount represents the shortfall in capital required to meet the financial needs of the transaction. 
If the Equity holders in the Deal own 100% of the equity of the post-closing company, the additional funds required will be treated as assumed equity provided and will be shown as a separate line in the Equity Section of the Balance Sheet. This indicates that the additional funds will be sourced from the Equity holders.
However, if the Equity holders in the Deal are not purchasing 100% of the equity of the post-closing company, the additional funds required will not be included in the Equity Section of the Balance Sheet. This is because the post-closing Balance Sheet represents 100% of the company, and the transaction is between the old equity holders and the new equity holders. In this case, the "Additional Funds Required" serves as informational data rather than a direct financial entry.
