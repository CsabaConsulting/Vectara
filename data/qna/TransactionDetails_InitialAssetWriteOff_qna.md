Question: What is the purpose of the Initial Asset Write Off provision?
Answer: The purpose of the Initial Asset Write Off provision is to allow the buyer of a company to reduce the initial value of an asset being purchased from the seller. This provision is used when the buyer has doubts about the value of the asset at the time of purchase or analysis. By writing off a percentage of the initial asset value, the buyer can reflect any confidence issues with the asset. It is important to note that the write off does not change the purchase price paid to the seller, but rather adjusts the beginning balance of the asset in the pre-closing transaction. The effect of the write off is to increase the goodwill paid for the company.
