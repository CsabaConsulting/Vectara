Question: What does Non Expense Cash Flow refer to in the ThruThink analysis?
Answer: In the ThruThink analysis, Non Expense Cash Flow refers to two separate items. Firstly, it includes the Non Expense Cash Flow items that come from the AJE (Adjusting Journal Entry) process but are not individually accounted for. These items can include AJEs for principal payments on debt, among others. The Non Expense Cash Flow from the AJEs will flow to the Cash Flow Control and the Sources and Uses of Cash, representing cash flow requirements.
Secondly, Non Expense Cash Flow also includes the Non Expense Cash Flow Items that come from the Non Cash Input page. These items can be used for Draws and Contributions. Non Expense Cash Flow refers to any use of Company cash for non-Company purposes. When a Draw is made, it is considered a reduction in the Company's Cash and Owners Equity. Draws do not affect the Income/Expense and are not deducted for tax calculations.
In the case of multiple Owners, Draws will be allocated to each owner based on the percentage of their Owners Equity. It is not allowed to have Draws for only one owner. On the other hand, a cash contribution can be made by entering a negative number. This will increase the Company's cash and increase the Owners Equity in the same percentage as each owner's equity ownership.
Overall, Non Expense Cash Flow Items can be entered by the User either through the Non Expense Cash Flow Input page or through an AJE entry.
