Question: What is the Company Sale Gain?
Answer: The Company Sale Gain is the amount by which the Market Value Sale of the company exceeds its book equity value. It is a measure of the profit or gain realized from the sale of the company. The Market Value can be determined using different methods such as a multiple of the company's EBITDA, a set given number, or a combination of both. The specific Market Value factors for an Exit Sale can be set in the Exit Strategy Inputs. It is important to note that the EBITDA Multiple method of valuation provides an ongoing measure of the company's value as it reflects its performance over time.

Question: How is the Market Value determined for an Exit Sale?
Answer: The Market Value for an Exit Sale can be determined using three methods in the ThruThink analysis: EBITDA Multiple, a set given number, or a combination of both. The EBITDA Multiple method calculates the Market Value based on a multiple of the Company's EBITDA. The set given number method allows the user to input a specific value for the Market Value. Additionally, a combination of both methods can be used to determine the Market Value. These Market Value factors are set in the Exit Strategy Inputs and can be specified for each individual year or for each year of the balance of the Horizon Years. The EBITDA Multiple method is particularly useful as it automatically reflects the performance of the company, providing an ongoing measure of value.

Question: How can the Market Value factors be set for an Exit Sale?
Answer: The Market Value factors for an Exit Sale can be set using the Exit Strategy Inputs. These factors can be set for one individual year at a time or for each year of the balance of the Horizon Years. The Market Value can be determined based on a multiple of the Company's EBITDA, a set given number (User Input), or a combination of both. The EBITDA Multiple method of valuation is recommended as it provides an easy measure of value on an ongoing basis and automatically reflects the performance of the company.

Question: What is the advantage of using the EBITDA Multiple method of valuation?
Answer: The advantage of using the EBITDA Multiple method of valuation is that it provides an easy measure of value on an ongoing basis and automatically reflects the performance of the company. This means that as the company's EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization) increases, the valuation of the company also increases. This method allows for a more dynamic and real-time assessment of the company's value, making it easier to track and evaluate its financial performance.

Question: When should the Exit Value be entered for Horizon time periods over 10 years?
Answer: For Horizon time periods over 10 years, it is recommended to enter an appropriate Exit Value for Year 10 as well as the end of the Horizon time period. This ensures that the valuation is accurate and comprehensive.

Question: What happens if there is no Market Value available for the Exit Value at year 10?
Answer: If there is no Market Value available for the Exit Value at year 10, the *ThruThink Evaluation* will use the Hard Asset liquidation value as the Exit Value. The Hard Asset liquidation value is one of the three types of valuation methods used in the ThruThink analysis, along with Market Value and Book Value. In this case, since there is no Market Value, the Sale Gain will not be applicable.

The specific Long Term Capital Gains rate used is an input by the User in the Tax Rate Input section.

Question: What are the three types of Valuation methods used in the ThruThink analysis?
Answer: The three types of Valuation methods used in the ThruThink analysis are:
1. Market Value: This method determines the value of the company based on factors such as the company's EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization), a set given number specified by the user, or a combination of both. The Market Value Sale Gain is calculated as the amount by which the Market Value Sale exceeds the book equity value of the company.
2. Book Value: This method determines the value of the company based on its book equity value. In the context of the ThruThink analysis, the Book Value type of Sale does not result in a Sale Gain.
3. Hard Asset Liquidation: This method determines the value of the company based on the liquidation value of its hard assets. Similar to the Book Value type of Sale, the Hard Asset Liquidation type of Sale does not result in a Sale Gain.
