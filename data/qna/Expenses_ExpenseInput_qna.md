2) Making % growth inputs over Base EBITDA on the Step 3 input page for each of the years 1-3. There is also one constant growth input for EBITDA that will be used for all remaining years of the Horizon period.

Question: How can the User input projections from the Historical Worksheet into the Cash Flow Control page?
Answer: To input projections from the Historical Worksheet into the Cash Flow Control page, the User can follow these steps:
1. Make projections for Years 1-3 in the Historical Worksheet process.
2. After making these projections, the User will have the option to input the projections into the Cash Flow Control page.
3. If the User chooses to input the projections from the Historical Worksheet into the Cash Flow Control page, they should skip Step 3 input.
4. The projections from the Historical Worksheet will be automatically transferred to the Cash Flow Control page.
5. On the Cash Flow Control page, the User will have the opportunity to make adjustments and overrides to the inputs transferred from the Historical Worksheet.
6. Any adjustments made on the Cash Flow Control page will override the inputs made on the Historical Worksheet.
It is important to note that the process of inputting projections from the Historical Worksheet into the Cash Flow Control page is a deliberate process, and the User will likely remember if they have done it.

Question: What inputs can the User make on the Step 3 input page?
Answer: On the Step 3 input page, the User can make the following inputs:
1) Projections for Years 1-3 in the Historical Worksheet process. If these projections are made, the User will have the option to input them into the Cash Flow Control page.
2) % growth inputs over Base Sales for each of the years 1-3.
3) % of Sales inputs for expenses for each of the years 1-3.
4) % growth inputs over Base EBITDA for each of the years 1-3.
5) One constant growth input for EBITDA that will be used for all remaining years of the Horizon period.
Additionally, there are override inputs available for each of these Step 3 inputs on the Cash Flow Control page. The User may choose to skip the inputs on the Step 3 page and make projections for Income/Expense or EBITDA directly on the Cash Flow Control page. If inputs are made on the Cash Flow Control page, they will override any inputs made on the Step 3 input page.
Furthermore, detailed individual inputs for Income and Expense can be made using the Individually Scheduled Item options on the Step 3 input page. These options provide individualized input options that are not available on the Step 3 input page or on the Cash Flow Control page. The results of these individually scheduled items, along with all the Income and Expense or EBITDA growth inputs on the Step 3 input page, will be included on the Cash Flow Control page. However, if inputs are made directly on the Cash Flow Control page, they will override the inputs made on the Step 3 input page and the individually scheduled items.

Question: Can the User make adjustments on the Cash Flow Control page?
Answer: Yes, the User can make adjustments on the Cash Flow Control page. If the User chooses to input projections from the Historical Worksheet into the Cash Flow Control page, they will have the option to make adjustments to the income/expense or EBITDA growth inputs that were made on the Step 3 input page. These adjustments will override the inputs made on the Step 3 input page. Additionally, the User can directly make projections for income/expense or EBITDA on the Cash Flow Control page without using the Step 3 input page. Any inputs made on the Cash Flow Control page will also override the inputs made on the Step 3 input page.

Question: What are the options for making detailed individual inputs for Income and Expense?
Answer: The options for making detailed individual inputs for Income and Expense are available through the "Individually Scheduled Item" options on the Step 3 input page. These options provide a way to input specific and customized details for Income and Expense items that are not available on the Step 3 input page or the Cash Flow Control page. 
By selecting the "Individually Scheduled Item" option, users can enter detailed information for each specific Income and Expense item separately. This allows for a more granular and precise input of data, tailored to the specific needs and characteristics of each item. 
It is important to note that the results of the Individually Scheduled Item inputs, along with all the other Income and Expense or EBITDA growth inputs on the Step 3 input page, will be displayed separately and included on the Cash Flow Control page. However, if these inputs are subsequently overridden by inputs directly on the Cash Flow Control page, they will no longer be visible from the Cash Flow Control page.

Question: Where will the Individually Scheduled Item results and all of the Income and Expense or EBITDA growth inputs show up?
Answer: The Individually Scheduled Item results and all of the Income and Expense or EBITDA growth inputs will show up separately and be included on the Cash Flow Control page. However, if these inputs are subsequently overridden by inputs directly on the Cash Flow Control page, they will no longer be visible from the Cash Flow Control page.

Question: What happens if inputs are made directly on the Cash Flow Control page?
Answer: If inputs are made directly on the Cash Flow Control page, they will override any inputs made on the Expense Input page. This means that the projections for Income/Expense or EBITDA made on the Cash Flow Control page will take precedence over the inputs made on the Expense Input page. The Cash Flow Control page provides the opportunity to make adjustments and modifications to the projections, allowing the user to have more control over the final results. Once inputs are made directly on the Cash Flow Control page, the inputs made on the Expense Input page will no longer be visible or considered in the calculations on the Cash Flow Control page.
