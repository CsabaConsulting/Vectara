Question: How should the Debt and Equity required to acquire the Existing Company be entered?
Answer: The Debt and Equity required to acquire the Existing Company should be entered using the Transaction Sheet options. This includes new acquisition debt as well as new Existing Company debt (after the Effective Date). If there are assets at the Existing Company that can be used for additional debt after the Effective Date, the additional debt should be entered on the Transaction Sheet. The proceeds from this debt, as well as Equity Debt and/or Contributions from outside Equity, will become part of the capital structure assembled to acquire the Existing Company. After the acquisition, all the debt and equity from both the Transaction Sheet and the Existing Company will be rolled into the post-closing Balance Sheet.

Question: How is the cash required of the Existing Company Equity as an equity member handled?
Answer: When the Existing Company is purchasing the Target Company, the cash required of the Existing Company Equity as an equity member will be taken from the cash listed on the Existing Company Input page. If there is enough cash in the Existing Company's balance sheet, the Existing Company Equity Partner cash contribution will be allowed as a cash input on the Transaction Sheet Equity Input. However, if there is not enough cash in the Existing Company's balance sheet, the Existing Company Equity Partner cash contribution above the cash amount shown on the Existing Company Balance Sheet will not be allowed as a cash input on the Transaction Sheet Equity Input. In other words, the cash required from the Existing Company Equity must be available in the Existing Company's balance sheet for it to be considered as a cash input on the Transaction Sheet Equity Input.

This means that the Sales and EBITDA information entered in Step 3 for the Existing Company and the Target Company will be combined and used as the basis for future financial analysis and decision-making.
