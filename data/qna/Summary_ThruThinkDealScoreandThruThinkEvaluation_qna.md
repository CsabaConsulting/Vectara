Question: What does the ThruThink Evaluation evaluate?
Answer: The ThruThink Evaluation evaluates the first 10 years of a deal or investment. It takes into account various factors such as risk rating, confidence level, cash flow characteristics, stability of projections, EBITDA to sales ratio, EBITDA to debt ratio, EBIT to total assets, working capital, net total debt, net income, quality of non-owner management, amount of un-compensated owner contribution, and liquidity of the business. These factors are used to assess the overall performance and potential of the deal or investment. It is important to note that the ThruThink Evaluation does not provide any representation, warranties, or guarantees about the outcome of the user's business.

Question: What factors are used to calculate the Risk Rating?
Answer: The Risk Rating is calculated using several factors. These factors include:
1. Modified Internal Rate of Return (MIRR): The Risk Rating uses MIRR with Beginning Total Assets as the initial cash outlay, projected EBITDA adjusted by cash flow impact of receivables, inventory, and A/P, along with an income tax estimate, and annual equity draws or contributions.
2. Confidence factor: The Risk Rating is further factored by a Confidence factor based on the historical EBITDA. If there is limited historical information, the Confidence factor will be low, which will substantially affect the Risk Rating.
3. Comparison with the current yield of 10 Year United States Treasury Notes: The Risk Rating is also factored by comparing it with the current yield of 10 Year United States Treasury Notes.
4. Market Value or Hard Asset Value: The Risk Rating uses the Market Value of the deal or Company after a Long Term Capital Gain tax deduction, without the Liabilities of the Company at the end of the earlier of 10 years or the Horizon Years as the cash return at the end of the investment. If a Market Value is not provided by the User, a Hard Asset Value (w/o amortized assets such as goodwill) liquidation of the assets will be used instead.
These factors are taken into account to determine the Risk Rating of a deal or investment.

Question: How is the Confidence Level calculated?
Answer: The Confidence Level is a proprietary calculation used by ThruThink. It is calculated on a scale of 1-100, with 1 being low confidence. The calculation takes into account the future projections for EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization) and compares them to the historical EBITDA actual performance. The level of confidence is determined based on how closely the future projections align with the historical performance. If there is limited historical information available, the confidence level will be lower, which will have a significant impact on the overall Risk Rating. It is important to note that while the Confidence Level provides a measure of confidence in future performance, it does not guarantee accurate predictions as future performance may not always align with historical activity.

Question: What does the Cash Flow Characteristics measure?
Answer: The Cash Flow Characteristics measure the beginning cash balance and the stability of the projected cumulative cash balance over the Horizon Years. It also takes into account whether the cumulative cash flow becomes negative within the Horizon Years. If the cumulative cash flow becomes negative, indicating that the company runs out of money, a negative score is given for Cash Flow Characteristics. The measured cash flow is the final annual cash flow of the company after debt payments, income taxes, capital expenditures, and owner draws.
---
Question: What does the Stability of Projections reflect?
Answer: The Stability of Projections reflects how representative the first three years projection for EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization) is compared to the historical EBITDA performance. If there is no historical performance available, the score will be zero. Additionally, a negative historical trend for EBITDA will detract from the score. In other words, the Stability of Projections evaluates the consistency and reliability of the projected EBITDA numbers for the first three years of the deal.

Question: How is the EBITDA to Sales Ratio calculated?
Answer: The EBITDA to Sales Ratio is calculated by comparing the EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization) to the Sales of a company. The ratio is determined by dividing the EBITDA by the Sales. 
In the given text, it is mentioned that the EBITDA to Sales Ratio takes into account the historical EBITDA/Sales ratio, the current EBITDA Ratio, and the ratio through the Year 3 projection. It also considers the stability and consistency of these numbers. If there is no historical data available, it will substantially reduce the EBITDA to Sales Ratio score.
It is important to note that the text does not provide specific details on the exact formula or calculation used to determine the EBITDA to Sales Ratio. For more precise information, it is recommended to refer to the ThruThink documentation or contact ThruThink directly.

Question: What does the EBITDA to Debt Ratio reflect?
Answer: The EBITDA to Debt Ratio reflects the relationship between EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization) and Total Debt in a company or deal. It is calculated by dividing the EBITDA by the Total Debt. 
This ratio is used to assess the company's ability to generate earnings in relation to its debt obligations. A ratio between 0 and 3 is considered Excellent to Good, indicating that the company has sufficient earnings to cover its debt. A ratio between 3 and 5 is considered Good to Marginal, suggesting that the company's ability to cover its debt is moderate. A ratio of 5 or above is considered Excessive and negative, indicating that the company may have difficulty meeting its debt obligations with its current level of earnings. 
In summary, the EBITDA to Debt Ratio provides insight into the company's financial health and its ability to manage its debt load.

Question: What does the EBIT to Total Assets reflect?
Answer: The EBIT to Total Assets reflects the earnings of a company as a percentage of the total assets deployed. It is a measure that puts the level of earnings into perspective with the amount of total assets involved. In other words, it shows how efficiently a company is generating earnings relative to the amount of assets it has. A higher EBIT to Total Assets ratio indicates that a company is generating more earnings per unit of assets, which is generally considered favorable.

Question: How is Working Capital defined?
Answer: Working Capital is defined as the difference between Current Assets and Current Liabilities. Current Assets include all assets that are cash or will turn into cash within 12 months of the specific date being considered. Current Liabilities include all debts that are due to be paid within 12 months of the date being considered, including the Current Portion of Long Term Debt, which is the portion of long-term debt that will be due in payments over the next 12 months. The score for Working Capital takes into account the Beginning Working Capital as well as the Working Capital for years 1-3, with a greater weight placed on the Beginning Working Capital.
---
Question: How is Net Debt calculated?
Answer: In the given text, it is mentioned that Net Debt is calculated by subtracting Cash and Accounts Receivable from Total Debt. Net Debt is used to consider the amount of debt or leverage in a company or deal. The ratio of Net Debt to Earnings before Interest, Income Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (EBITDA) expresses the effect of leverage or debt on a company or deal.

Question: What does the Quality of Non Owner Management score reflect?
Answer: The Quality of Non Owner Management score reflects the level of independence of the management of the company from the owner. It is a direct input by the user and is rated on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 indicating no involvement of the owner and 10 indicating a high level of involvement. The score takes into account the extent to which the management provides technical, financial, or operational expertise that is materially or uniquely contributed by the owner. It also considers both compensated and uncompensated contributions of the owner. Additionally, the score reflects the overall capability of the management separate from the owner.
---
Question: What does the Amount of Un-Compensated Owner Contribution score reflect?
Answer: The Amount of Un-Compensated Owner Contribution score reflects the annual amount of necessary and material involvement of the Owner that is not compensated. It represents the contribution that would need to be replaced if the Owner were not present. The score is based on the comparison of the amount of Un-Compensated Owner Contribution with the Beginning EBITDA.
---
Question: What is the Liquidity of the Business measure?
Answer: The Liquidity of the Business measure is a direct input provided by the user. It is an estimate of the number of months it would take to sell the company. This measure reflects the ease with which the business can be converted into cash. Generally, the estimated time frame for selling the company can range from 5 to 36 months.
