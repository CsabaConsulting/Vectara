Question: How can the User enter projections for Income & Expense?
Answer: There are several options for the User to enter projections for Income & Expense:
1) The User can make projections for Years 1-3 in the Historical Worksheet process. After making these projections, the User will have the option to input the projections into the Cash Flow Control page.
2) The User can make % growth inputs over Base Sales on the Step 3 input page. This includes % of Sales inputs for expenses for each of the years 1-3 and one constant growth input that will be used for all remaining years of the Horizon period.
3) The User can make % growth inputs over Base EBITDA on the Step 3 input page. This includes % growth inputs for each of the years 1-3 and one constant growth input for EBITDA that will be used for all remaining years of the Horizon period.
4) The User can use override inputs available for each of these Step 3 inputs on the Cash Flow Control page. This allows the User to skip the inputs on the Step 3 input page and make projections for Income/Expense directly on the Cash Flow Control page. Any inputs made on the Cash Flow Control page will override the inputs made on the Step 3 input page.
5) The User can make detailed individual inputs for Income and Expense by using the Individually Scheduled Item options on the Step 3 input page. This provides individualized input options that are not available on the Step 3 input page or on the Cash Flow Control page.
It is important to note that the Individually Scheduled Item results and all of the Income and Expense growth inputs on the Step 3 input page will be included on the Cash Flow Control page. However, if these inputs are overridden by inputs directly on the Cash Flow Control page, they will no longer be visible from the Cash Flow Control page.

Question: What options are available for entering % growth inputs over Base EBITDA?
Answer: The options available for entering % growth inputs over Base EBITDA are as follows:
1) The User may make % growth inputs over Base EBITDA on the Step 3 input page for each of the years 1-3. This allows the User to input specific growth rates for each year within the initial 3-year period.
2) The User may also make one constant growth input for EBITDA that will be used for all remaining years of the Horizon period. This means that after the initial 3-year period, the same growth rate will be applied to EBITDA for the remaining years.
These options provide flexibility for the User to input different growth rates for the initial years and a constant growth rate for the subsequent years.

Question: Can the User make adjustments on the Cash Flow Control page?
Answer: Yes, the User can make adjustments on the Cash Flow Control page. The page allows the User to override inputs made on the Step 3 input page for both Income/Expense and EBITDA growth projections. If the User chooses to make adjustments on the Cash Flow Control page, these adjustments will override any inputs made on the previous pages. It is important to note that once adjustments are made on the Cash Flow Control page, the previous inputs will no longer be visible from that page.

Question: What are the Individually Scheduled Item options used for?
Answer: The Individually Scheduled Item options are used for making detailed individual inputs for Income and Expense. These options provide a way to input specific and customized growth projections that are not available on the Step 3 input page or on the Cash Flow Control page. By using the Individually Scheduled Item options on the Step 3 input page, users can make specific projections for each item separately, allowing for more granular control over the growth projections. 
The results of the Individually Scheduled Item inputs, along with all the other Income and Expense or EBITDA growth inputs made on the Step 3 input page, will be displayed separately and included on the Cash Flow Control page. However, if the inputs on the Cash Flow Control page override these inputs, they will no longer be visible from the Cash Flow Control page. 
In summary, the Individually Scheduled Item options provide a way to input detailed and customized growth projections for specific Income and Expense items, giving users more flexibility and control over their projections.

Question: Where will the Individually Scheduled Item results and all of the Income and Expense or EBITDA growth inputs show up?
Answer: The Individually Scheduled Item results and all of the Income and Expense or EBITDA growth inputs will show up separately and be included on the Cash Flow Control page. However, if these inputs are subsequently overridden by inputs directly on the Cash Flow Control page, they will no longer be visible from the Cash Flow Control page.

Question: What happens if the inputs on the Cash Flow Control page override the Step 3 inputs?
Answer: If the inputs on the Cash Flow Control page override the Step 3 inputs, the overridden inputs will no longer be visible from the Cash Flow Control page. This means that any growth projections for Income/Expense or EBITDA that were initially entered on the Step 3 input page will be replaced by the inputs made directly on the Cash Flow Control page. The Cash Flow Control page takes precedence over the Step 3 input page in determining the projections for Income/Expense or EBITDA.
