Question: What is the purpose of the Tax Rate Schedule?
Answer: The purpose of the Tax Rate Schedule is to provide a convenient reference for estimating income tax expenses. It is a tool for users to input generalized tax rates that can be used to calculate an estimated expense for income taxes. The default entries in the schedule are very general in nature and should be updated by the user to reflect specific tax rates for a particular year, country, state, or region. The Tax Rate Schedule is used in conjunction with the user inputs to calculate income tax expenses on the accrual basis. It is important to note that the income tax calculations in this analysis are not intended to reflect actual tax computations based on any tax code. Therefore, it is recommended to consult a tax specialist and use the appropriate tax code for a more specific estimate of tax expenses or liabilities in any individual situation.

Question: How are Income Tax Expense and Liability for Income Taxes Due calculated?
Answer: Income Tax Expense and Liability for Income Taxes Due are calculated on the Accrual Basis. The Tax Rate Schedule provided is for general reference and convenience, and any default entries are very general in nature. It is important to note that these calculations are not intended to reflect actual tax computations based on any specific tax code.
The analysis considers two types of income tax: Federal or Country Income Tax and State or Region Income Tax. The Tax Rate Input page allows for up to seven graduated taxable income levels for each type of tax, although the default is just one tax level for all taxable net income. The User has the flexibility to adjust these rates accordingly.
The *ThruThink* analysis applies the rates shown in the Tax Rate Input page to the Taxable Net Income calculated by the analysis for future years. Taxable Net Income is a generalized assessment of taxable net income, calculated as EBITDA less Interest paid less the Tax basis depreciation and amortization expense.
For Cash Flow purposes, estimated tax payments are made on a quarterly basis during the Taxable Year in Periods 4, 6, 9, and 12. Actual taxes are then calculated for the Taxable Year and paid in Period 4 of the following year, taking into account the estimated payments made during the Taxable Year.
At the end of the Taxable Year, there will be an Income Tax Liability, which represents the difference between the Taxes Owed and the estimated tax payments made during the Taxable Year.
It is important to consult with a tax specialist and refer to the appropriate tax code for a more specific estimate of tax expense or liability in any individual situation.
