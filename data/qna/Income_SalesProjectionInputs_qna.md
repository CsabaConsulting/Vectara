Question: How many ways are there to enter future Sales?
Answer: There are three ways to enter future Sales:
1. Percentage change for Sales: On the Step 3 Sales and EBITDA Input page, you can enter a percentage change for Sales for each of years 1-3, as well as a percentage change for all years after Year 3. This method is quick and less time-consuming, and is typically done while entering Base Sales and/or Base EBITDA Inputs in Step 3.
2. Percentage change for Sales for each year in Horizon Years: On the Cash Flow Control page, you can enter a percentage change for Sales for each year in the Horizon Years. These entries will override any conflicting entries made on the Sales and EBITDA page in Step 3 and can be used to adjust the Sales projections. This method is useful for adjusting Expenses while being able to see the resulting financial impact.
3. Individual Scheduled Item pages: For more detailed Sales inputs, you can use the Individual Scheduled Item pages to input individual income projections in detail. This method is particularly useful when specific detailed income projections are necessary. Inputs can be made in the form of Units and $/Unit for these inputs.

Question: Where can you enter a % change for Sales for each year for each of the Horizon Years?
Answer: You can enter a % change for Sales for each year for each of the Horizon Years on the Cash Flow Control page.

This method is particularly useful when reviewing the Cash Flow results and wanting to make adjustments to Expenses while being able to see the resulting financial impact.

Question: What happens if there are conflicting entries made on the Sales and EBITDA page in Step 3 and the Cash Flow Control page?
Answer: If there are conflicting entries made on the Sales and EBITDA page in Step 3 and the Cash Flow Control page, the entries made on the Cash Flow Control page will override the entries made on the Sales and EBITDA page. This means that the % change for Sales for each year for each of the Horizon Years entered on the Cash Flow Control page will take precedence over the % change for Sales entered on the Sales and EBITDA page. This allows users to adjust the Sales projections and see the resulting financial impact while reviewing the Cash Flow results.

Question: When would you use the Individual Scheduled Item pages to input income projections?
Answer: The Individual Scheduled Item pages should be used to input income projections in detail when specific and detailed income projections are necessary. This method is useful when you need to provide more specific information about the income, such as the number of units and the price per unit. It allows for a more granular and accurate representation of the income projections.
