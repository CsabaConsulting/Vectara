Question: What does EBITDA reflect?
Answer: EBITDA (Earnings before Interest, Income Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization) reflects a company's operating performance before the effect of interest, taxes, and non-cash expenses of depreciation and amortization. It is commonly used as a measure of a company's true performance from its operations. EBITDA excludes these factors because they are considered separate from the earnings capability of the company. By focusing on the earnings from operations, EBITDA provides a good indication of a company's profitability.

Question: Why is EBITDA commonly used as a measure of a company's true performance?
Answer: EBITDA (Earnings before Interest, Income Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization) is commonly used as a measure of a company's true performance because it reflects the company's operating performance prior to the effect of interest, taxes, and non-cash expenses of depreciation and amortization. By excluding these factors, EBITDA provides a clearer picture of the company's ability to generate earnings from its core operations.
Interest expenses are often related to the company's debt structure and are considered a separate issue from its earnings capability. Taxes are assumed to be driven by the company's earnings and are not considered part of its operations. Depreciation and amortization are non-cash expenses that represent the estimated loss in value of fixed assets over time and use.
By focusing on EBITDA, investors and analysts can assess the company's operational efficiency and profitability without the distortions caused by interest, taxes, and non-cash expenses. This metric allows for better comparability between companies in different industries or with different capital structures. However, it is important to note that EBITDA does not provide a complete picture of a company's financial health and should be used in conjunction with other financial measures and analysis.

Question: What does EBITDA indicate about a company's earnings from operations?
Answer: EBITDA (Earnings before Interest, Income Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization) is a financial metric that reflects a company's operating performance before the impact of interest, taxes, and non-cash expenses such as depreciation and amortization. It is commonly used as a measure of a company's true earnings from its operations.
By excluding interest, which is often related to the company's debt structure and not directly tied to its operational performance, EBITDA provides a clearer picture of the company's ability to generate earnings. Similarly, taxes are assumed to be driven by the company's earnings and are not considered part of its operations. Depreciation and amortization, being non-cash expenses, are estimates of the loss in value of fixed assets over time and use.
EBITDA is considered a good indication of a company's earnings from operations because it focuses solely on the core business activities and eliminates the impact of non-operational factors. It allows investors and analysts to assess the company's profitability and compare it to other companies in the same industry.
However, it is important to note that EBITDA does not provide a complete picture of a company's financial health. It does not take into account factors such as interest expenses, taxes, and the impact of capital expenditures. Therefore, it should be used in conjunction with other financial metrics and analysis to get a comprehensive understanding of a company's earnings and financial performance.

Question: What should be considered for companies with a substantial investment in depreciable assets?
Answer: For companies with a substantial investment in depreciable assets, there are a few considerations that should be taken into account. Firstly, it is important to ensure that expenses for repairs reflect an appropriate amount to keep the assets in good condition. This means that the company should allocate enough funds for maintenance and repairs to maintain the value and functionality of the assets.
Additionally, capital expenditures (CapEx) should be included in the cash flow control input area to represent an adequate asset replacement schedule. This means that the company should plan and budget for the replacement of fixed assets over time. By including CapEx in the financial planning, the company can ensure that the contribution value of the assets to operating earnings is maintained or improved.
Overall, the key consideration for companies with substantial investment in depreciable assets is to carefully manage and allocate resources for repairs and maintenance, as well as plan for the replacement of assets through capital expenditures. This will help maintain the value and functionality of the assets and contribute to the overall earnings from operations of the company.

Question: How is the economic value of a company's operations often expressed?
Answer: The economic value of a company's operations is often expressed as a multiple of the company's EBITDA (Earnings before Interest, Income Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization). This multiple can range from a low of 2-3 to a high of over 10 for private companies. The actual multiple used depends on the stability of the present EBITDA going forward and the level of risk associated with it. If there is a strong case that the EBITDA will substantially increase in the future with an acceptable level of risk, a higher multiple is justified. On the other hand, if the EBITDA growth is declining or there is a high risk of EBITDA volatility, a lower multiple is justified.

Question: What determines the actual multiple used for a company's EBITDA?
Answer: The actual multiple used for a company's EBITDA is determined by the stability of the present EBITDA going forward, considering a certain level of risk. If there is a strong case that the EBITDA will substantially increase in the future at an acceptable risk level, a higher multiple is justified. On the other hand, if the EBITDA growth is declining or there is a high risk of EBITDA volatility, a lower multiple is justified. Generally, the EBITDA multiple ranges from 2-3 for low multiples to over 10 for high multiples, especially for private companies.

Question: How can EBITDA multiples be set for a market value sale of a company?
Answer: EBITDA multiples for a market value sale of a company can be set using the Step 7 - Exit Strategy Input page. This page allows the user to indicate a market value EBITDA multiple as well as a direct market value. Additionally, certain asset categories on the balance sheet, such as accounts receivable, inventory, notes receivable, equipment, or real estate, can be excluded from the market value sale.
The EBITDA multiple can be set for one individual year at a time or for each year of the horizon years. This method of valuation provides an easy measure of value on an ongoing basis as it automatically reflects the performance of the company.
The Step 7 - Exit Strategy page also indicates a breakeven EBITDA multiple, which is an estimated calculation representing the return of the equity group's investment. It is calculated by using the value of all assets less the cash balance. If there are cumulative net losses, the amount of those losses will be added back to represent a reimbursement of those losses.
It is important to note that the cash balance of the company, as well as its debt, are not usually included in a market valuation. Therefore, for a net benefit from a market value exit sale, cash is added to the market value, and the debt is subtracted along with any excluded asset categories mentioned above.
When setting the exit value, it is recommended to enter an appropriate exit value for Year 10 as well as the end of the horizon time period, especially for horizon time periods over 10 years. If there is no market value available, the *ThruThink Evaluation* will use the hard asset liquidation value for the exit value at year 10.

Question: What is the purpose of the Step 7 - Exit Strategy Input page?
Answer: The purpose of the Step 7 - Exit Strategy Input page is to determine the market value of a company based on its EBITDA multiple. This page allows the user to input a market value EBITDA multiple, as well as a direct market value. It also provides the option to exclude certain asset categories from the market value sale, such as accounts receivable, inventory, notes receivable, equipment, or real estate. 
The Exit Strategy page is used to calculate the breakeven EBITDA multiple, which represents the estimated calculation to return the equity group's investment. This is calculated by subtracting the cash balance from the value of all assets. If there are cumulative net losses, the amount of those losses is added back to represent reimbursement. 
It is important to note that the cash balance and debt of the company are typically not included in a market valuation. Therefore, for a net benefit from a market value exit sale, cash is added to the market value, and debt is subtracted, along with any excluded asset categories. 
The Exit Strategy page allows for setting the exit value for the end of the horizon time period. If the horizon time period is over 10 years, it is recommended to enter an appropriate exit value for year 10 as well as the end of the horizon time period. If there is no market value available, the *ThruThink Evaluation* will use the hard asset liquidation value for the exit value at year 10.

Question: How is the Breakeven EBITDA Multiple calculated for an exit sale?
Answer: The Breakeven EBITDA Multiple for an exit sale is calculated by using the value of all the assets of the company, excluding the cash balance. Additionally, if there are cumulative net losses, the amount of those losses will be added back to represent a reimbursement of those losses. The cash balance of the company and its debt are not usually included in a market valuation. Therefore, for a net benefit from a market value exit sale, cash is added to the market value, and the debt is subtracted along with any excluded asset categories on the balance sheet, such as accounts receivable, inventory, notes receivable, equipment, or real estate.

Question: What is included and excluded in a market valuation of a company?
Answer: In a market valuation of a company, certain items are included while others are excluded. Included in the market valuation are the earnings before Interest, Income Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA), which reflects the company's operating performance. Additionally, the market valuation includes the value of all assets, excluding the cash balance and debt of the company. 
Excluded from the market valuation are certain asset categories on the balance sheet, such as Accounts Receivable (A/R), Inventory, Notes Receivable, Equipment, and Real Estate. These assets are not considered in the market valuation. 
It is important to note that the market valuation may also consider the stability and growth potential of the EBITDA going forward, as well as the risk level associated with the company. This assessment helps determine the appropriate EBITDA multiple to be used in the valuation. 
Furthermore, for an exit sale, the market valuation may also include a breakeven EBITDA multiple, which represents the estimated calculation to return the equity group's investment. This calculation takes into account the value of all assets, excluding the cash balance, and may also add back cumulative net losses to reimburse those losses. 
Overall, the market valuation of a company includes EBITDA and the value of assets, while excluding certain asset categories, cash balance, and debt.

Question: What should be entered for Horizon time periods over 10 years?
Answer: For Horizon time periods over 10 years, it is recommended to enter an appropriate Exit Value for Year 10 as well as the end of the Horizon time period. This is because the *ThruThink Evaluation* only evaluates the first 10 years of a deal and will use the Hard Asset liquidation value for the Exit Value at year 10 if there is no Market Value available.
---
Question: What does the *ThruThink Evaluation* use for the Exit Value at year 10 if there is no Market Value available?
Answer: If there is no Market Value available for the Exit Value at year 10, the *ThruThink Evaluation* will use the Hard Asset liquidation value as the Exit Value.

Question: What does the Step 7 - Exit Strategy page indicate about the Breakeven EBITDA Multiple for an Exit Sale?
Answer: The Step 7 - Exit Strategy page indicates that the Breakeven EBITDA Multiple for an Exit Sale is an approximate calculation used to represent the return of the Equity Group's investment. It is calculated by subtracting the Cash balance from the value of all the Assets. Additionally, if there are cumulative net losses, the amount of those losses will be added back to represent a reimbursement of those losses. The Cash balance and Debt of the Company are not typically included in a Market Valuation.

Question: What is added and subtracted to calculate the net benefit from a Market Value Exit Sale?
Answer: To calculate the net benefit from a Market Value Exit Sale, the following items are added and subtracted:
1. Cash: The cash balance of the company is added to the market value. This is because cash is considered a valuable asset that contributes to the overall value of the company.
2. Debt: The debt of the company is subtracted from the market value. Debt represents the financial obligations of the company and needs to be accounted for when determining the net benefit.
3. Excluded asset categories: Certain asset categories on the balance sheet, such as accounts receivable (A/R), inventory, notes receivable, equipment, or real estate, may be excluded from the market value calculation. These excluded assets are subtracted from the market value.
By adding cash and subtracting debt and any excluded asset categories, the net benefit from a Market Value Exit Sale can be determined.
