Question: What is the Seller Retained Asset Lease category?
Answer: The Seller Retained Asset Lease category refers to the expenses associated with any assets that are retained by the seller at the close of escrow, such as real property, buildings, or fixed in place equipment. These assets are to be used by the company, and their value needs to be included in the projected expenses of the company. The category includes an annual lease percentage that represents the expense of leasing these retained assets. This lease expense is separate from the value of seller assets retained in the purchase price and is intended to be a priority expense that is not affected by an EBITDA override. The lease represented in this category may also include other assets owned by the seller or another party, as required by the user. The percentage used in the lease calculation should reflect an appropriate annual charge for the use of the assets. It is important to note that this category should not be used for post-close of escrow asset leases and is primarily intended for assets like buildings or real estate that are not typically part of a company purchase.

Question: What types of assets can be retained by the Seller?
Answer: The types of assets that can be retained by the Seller include real property, buildings, and fixed in place equipment. These assets are to be used by the Company and need to be included in the projected expenses.

Question: Where should the value of the retained assets be included?
Answer: The value of the retained assets should be included in the projected expenses of the company. This can be done by using an annual lease percentage as an input in Step 7. The value used in this input is the value upon which the user wishes to base a rent or lease payment. It is important to note that this value is separate from the value of seller assets retained in the purchase price input in Step 4. However, it may be the same value or a different value depending on the user's preference. The purpose of including the value of retained assets in Step 7 is to prioritize it as an expense that will not be affected by an EBITDA override.

Question: What is the purpose of the annual lease percentage?
Answer: The purpose of the annual lease percentage is to represent the expense of assets retained by the seller at the close of escrow, such as real property, buildings, or fixed in place equipment, that will be used by the company. This percentage is used as an input in Step 7 of the calculation. It allows the user to determine the appropriate annual charge for the use of these assets, which will be included in the projected expenses of the company. The annual lease percentage is separate from the value of seller assets retained in the purchase price and can be the same or different value. It is used to calculate a priority expense that will not be affected by an EBITDA override. This calculation is intended for assets required for normal operations of the company that would not be acquired with the purchase of the company, such as real estate. It should not be used for post-close of escrow asset leases.

Question: Is the value of Seller Assets retained in the Purchase Price input the same as the value used in Step 7?
Answer: The text states that the value of Seller Assets retained in the Purchase Price input in Step 4 may or may not be the same as the value used in Step 7. The distinction is that the value used in Step 7 is the value upon which the user wishes to base a rent or lease payment. Therefore, while the values in Step 4 and Step 7 may be the same, they can also be different depending on the user's preference.

Question: Can the lease represented in Step 7 include assets owned by parties other than the Seller?
Answer: Yes, the lease represented in Step 7 can include assets owned by parties other than the Seller. The documentation states that the lease represented in Step 7 may also represent any other assets owned by the Seller or other party as required by the User. This means that the User has the flexibility to include assets owned by parties other than the Seller in the lease calculation.

Question: Why is Step 7 used for the lease calculation?
Answer: Step 7 is used for the lease calculation because it allows the user to prioritize the lease expense and ensure that it is not affected by an EBITDA override. This step is specifically designed for the user to input an expense for assets that are necessary for the normal operations of the company but are not included in the purchase price. By using Step 7, the user can calculate a simple annual percent lease or fixed payment for these assets and ensure that it is treated as a separate and independent expense. This is particularly useful for assets like buildings or real estate that the company uses but are not typically part of a company purchase.

Question: What is the intended use of the annual percent lease or fixed payment calculation?
Answer: The intended use of the annual percent lease or fixed payment calculation is to provide the user with the ability to input an expense for assets that are required for the normal operations of the company but are not included in the purchase price. This calculation is separate from the value of seller assets retained in the purchase price input. It is used to represent the value of assets retained by the seller at the close of escrow, such as real property, buildings, or fixed in place equipment, that are to be used by the company. The annual lease percentage is used to determine the expense associated with these retained assets. This calculation is independent of the seller retained assets in step 4 and can also represent any other assets owned by the seller or another party as required by the user. The purpose of using this calculation is to prioritize this expense and ensure that it is not affected by an EBITDA override. It is important to note that this calculation should not be used for post close of escrow asset leases and the percentage used should reflect an appropriate annual charge for the use of the assets.

Question: Should this calculation be used for post close of escrow asset leases?
Answer: No, this calculation should not be used for post close of escrow asset leases. The text explicitly states that this calculation is intended for assets that are required for normal operations of the company but are not included in the purchase price. It specifically mentions that it should not be used for post close of escrow (Effective Date) asset leases. The calculation is designed to represent an appropriate annual charge for the use of assets that are retained by the seller and used by the company.

Question: What should the percentage used in the calculation represent?
Answer: The percentage used in the calculation should represent an appropriate annual charge for the use of the assets retained by the Seller at the close of escrow. This includes assets such as real property, buildings, and fixed in place equipment that are to be used by the Company. The percentage is an input in Step 7 and is used to determine the annual Seller Lease expense. It is important to note that this percentage is separate from the Value of Seller Assets retained in the Purchase Price input in Step 4. The value used in Step 7 is the value upon which the User wishes to base a rent or lease payment. The percentage should accurately reflect the cost of using these assets for normal operations of the Company.
