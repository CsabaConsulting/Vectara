Question: How are annual payments on the Real Estate Debt calculated?
Answer: Annual payments on the Real Estate Debt are calculated by adding the interest on the outstanding balance of the loan at the prior year end to the principal. The principal amount is determined by dividing 1 by the remaining years of the loan. For example, if the loan has a duration of 10 years, the principal repayment for the first year would be 1/10 or 10%, for the second year it would be 1/9 or 11.1%, and for the third year it would be 1/8 or 12.5%. 
It is important to note that the principal repayment calculation is flexible and adjusts with the remaining years of the loan if there are any additional advances or payments made during the life of the loan. This provision allows for increased loan amounts or additional payments, similar to a Line of Credit situation. It provides the user with the flexibility to adjust the loan amounts based on cash flow needs and test different scenarios in future years.
If a Balloon Year is indicated by the user, the remaining balance of the loan, including any advances made in the previous year, will be paid off in that year. 
If the user requires other principal repayment options such as amortized, level principal, monthly payments, quarterly payments, etc., they can utilize the Individually Scheduled Item Input option.

Question: How is the amount of principal repayment calculated for each year of the loan?
Answer: The amount of principal repayment for each year of the loan is calculated by dividing 1 by the remaining years of the loan. For example, if you have a 10-year loan, the principal repayment for year 1 would be 1/10 or 10%, for year 2 it would be 1/9 or 11.1%, and for year 3 it would be 1/8 or 12.5%. This calculation is based on the outstanding balance of the loan at the prior year end.

Question: What happens if an advance is made on the loan after the original loan is made?
Answer: If an advance is made on the loan after the original loan is made, the loan duration is reset to the original term. This means that the remaining years of the loan will be recalculated based on the new advance amount. As a result, the principal repayment calculation will float with the remaining years of the loan, taking into account any additional advances made. This provision allows for flexibility in adjusting the loan amounts and reflects a Line of Credit situation, where the user can make additional advances and paybacks as needed.
