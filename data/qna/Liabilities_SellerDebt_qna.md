Question: What is Seller Debt?
Answer: Seller Debt refers to a provision in which the seller of a company agrees to take back a portion of the purchase price as a Note Payable. This option is commonly used for financing a portion of a company acquisition. The Seller Debt is divided into different components, including the Base Note, the Performance Earn Out Note, and the Current Pay and Non Current Pay portions.
The Base Note is further broken down into the Current Pay Portion and the Non Current Pay Portion. The Current Pay portion calculates automatic payments, either amortized or interest-only, as specified. On the other hand, the Non Current Pay portion does not have automatic interest or principal payments calculated. Instead, it accrues interest at a selected rate, and the principal and interest can be paid off with manual excess cash payments.
The separation of the Seller Note into Current Pay and Non Current Pay is done to comply with possible conditions set by senior or sub debt lenders. These lenders may require that the seller not be paid ahead of them. If this condition applies, the Seller Debt can be designated as Non Current Pay and paid from the Cash Flow Control page when there is extra cash and the lender criteria permit.
In terms of excess payments from the Cash Flow Control, any excess cash will first be applied to outstanding interest on the Non Current Pay Seller Note, then to the principal on the Non Current Pay Seller Note. After that, it will be applied to the outstanding interest of the Performance Earn Out Note, and if the Performance Earn Out Note is not amortized, it will be applied to the principal of that note. Finally, any remaining excess cash will be applied to the interest and principal of the Current Pay Seller Note.
When it comes to adjusting journal entries (AJE) related to Seller Debt, AJE entries to Seller Interest Expense will be applied to the Current Pay Seller Note Interest. AJE entries to the Seller Debt Accrued Interest will be applied first to the Non Current Pay Seller Note accrued interest and then to the Current Pay Seller Note accrued interest. However, an AJE cannot be made to the Accrued Interest for the Earn Out Seller Note.
In terms of AJE to Principal, if there is a Non Current Pay Seller Note balance, AJE entries to the Seller Debt Principal amount will be applied to that note first. If there is no balance on the Non Current Pay Seller Note, the AJE will be applied to the Current Pay Seller Note, and then to the Earn Out Seller Note.

Question: How is the Seller Debt commonly used?
Answer: The Seller Debt is commonly used as a financing option for a portion of a Company Acquisition. It allows the Seller to take back a portion of the purchase price of the Company as a Note Payable. This means that instead of receiving the full purchase price upfront, the Seller agrees to receive payments over time in the form of a promissory note.
The Seller Debt is divided into different components. The first component is the Base Note, which is further broken down into the Current Pay Portion and the Non Current Pay Portion. The Current Pay Portion calculates automatic payments, either amortized or interest-only, as specified. On the other hand, the Non Current Pay Portion does not have automatic interest or principal payments calculated. Instead, it accrues interest at a selected rate, and the principal and interest can be paid off with manual excess cash payments.
In addition to the Base Note, there is also a Performance Earn Out Note available to the Seller. This note provides the Seller with an incentive to take back a Note. The specific terms and conditions of the Performance Earn Out Note are not mentioned in the given text.
The separation of the Seller Note into Current Pay and Non Current Pay is done to satisfy possible Senior or Sub Debt lender conditions. This ensures that the Seller does not get paid ahead of the Senior or Sub Debt. If required by the lender, the Seller Debt can be made Non Current Pay and paid from the Cash Flow Control page when there is extra cash and the lender criteria permit.
Overall, the Seller Debt is a financing option that allows the Seller to receive a portion of the purchase price over time, providing flexibility and potentially meeting lender requirements.

This means that any extra cash available can be used to make payments towards the interest and principal of the Non Current Pay Note.

Question: What is the order of priority for excess cash pay down?
Answer: The order of priority for excess cash pay down is as follows:
1. Outstanding interest on the Non-Current Pay Seller Note
2. Principal on the Non-Current Pay Seller Note
3. Outstanding interest on the Performance Earn Out Note
4. Principal on the Performance Earn Out Note (if it is not amortized)
5. Interest on the Current Pay Seller Note
6. Principal on the Current Pay Seller Note
It is important to note that if there is a need to increase the note, a negative number can be inserted, which will increase both the note and the cash. In such a case, the increase will be applied to the Non-Current Pay Seller Note.
---
Question: What happens if a negative number is inserted for excess cash pay down?
Answer: If a negative number is inserted for excess cash pay down, it signifies an increase in the note amount. This increase in the note will be applied to the Non Current Pay Seller Note. In other words, instead of making a payment towards the note, the negative number indicates that the note balance is being increased, resulting in an increase in cash.
