Question: How are Asset Sales entered on the Capital Expenditure Input page?
Answer: Asset Sales are entered as a negative Capital Expenditure on the Capital Expenditure Input page listed in Step 7. The negative number input represents the proceeds from the Asset sale. By entering a negative number as an Asset Sale, it will reduce the Gross Value of the Asset Class and increase Cash in the *ThruThink* analysis. However, to fully represent the Asset Sale, multiple accounting style Adjusting Journal Entries (AJE) in Step 7 will need to be made. These AJEs will record the Gain (Loss) on Sale of Assets, reduce the Accumulated Depreciation, and adjust the Asset Value to reflect the removal of the Book Value of the asset instead of the proceeds from the sale.

Question: What does the negative number input for Asset Sales represent?
Answer: The negative number input for Asset Sales represents the proceeds from the sale of an asset. In the *ThruThink* analysis, entering a negative number as an Asset Sale will reduce the Gross Value of the Asset Class and increase the Cash balance. This negative number is used to reflect the removal of the Book Value of the asset, rather than the proceeds from the sale.

Question: In the *ThruThink* analysis, how does entering a negative number for Asset Sales affect the Gross Value of the Asset Class and Cash?
Answer: Entering a negative number for Asset Sales in the *ThruThink* analysis will reduce the Gross Value of the Asset Class and increase Cash. The negative number represents the proceeds from the Asset sale. By entering this negative number, the analysis recognizes that the Asset has been sold and adjusts the Gross Value of the Asset Class accordingly. Additionally, the Cash balance increases as a result of receiving the proceeds from the Asset sale.

Question: What accounting style Adjusting Journal Entries (AJE) need to be made to fully represent an Asset Sale?
Answer: To fully represent an Asset Sale, multiple accounting style Adjusting Journal Entries (AJE) need to be made. These AJEs should be made in Step 7 of the analysis. The following AJEs are required:
1. Gain (Loss) on Sale of Assets: An AJE needs to be made to record the gain or loss on the sale of assets. This entry will reflect the difference between the proceeds from the sale and the book value of the asset being sold.
2. Reduction of Accumulated Depreciation: Another AJE is required to reduce the accumulated depreciation of the asset being sold. This entry will adjust the depreciation expense that has been recorded over the life of the asset.
3. Adjustment of Asset Value: An AJE should be made to adjust the asset value to reflect the removal of the book value of the asset. This entry will ensure that the asset is no longer included in the balance sheet.
It is important to note that these AJEs are necessary to accurately represent the asset sale. Without making these entries, all asset sales will be considered as net book value, and no gain or loss will be recognized until the proceeds from the sale exceed the entire value of the asset class.
Additionally, it is mentioned that all gains from asset sales will be considered as Long Term Capital Gains if the assets have been held for over one year. Capital losses from the sale of assets will be carried forward to apply against future capital gains, and no capital losses will be applied against ordinary income.
It is recommended to refer to the Help - Capital Gain section for further information on this topic.

Question: How are gains from asset sales classified?
Answer: Gains from asset sales are classified as Long Term Capital Gains.

Question: How are losses from asset sales treated?
Answer: Losses from asset sales are treated as capital losses. In the *ThruThink* analysis, if an asset is sold at a loss, the negative number entered as an asset sale will reduce the gross value of the asset class and increase cash. However, to fully represent the asset sale, multiple adjusting journal entries (AJE) need to be made in Step 7. These AJEs will record the loss on the sale of assets, reduce the accumulated depreciation, and adjust the asset value to reflect the removal of the book value of the asset.
Capital losses from the sale of assets will be carried into future years to apply against future capital gains. It is important to note that no capital loss will be applied against ordinary income. This means that the losses can only be used to offset capital gains in future years.
If adjusting journal entries are not made to record the loss and adjustment to accumulated depreciation, all asset sales will be considered as net book value, and no loss will be recognized until the asset sale proceeds exceed the entire asset class value.
In cases where the proceeds from the asset sale exceed the gross value of the asset class (prior to depreciation), the asset class value will be reduced to zero, and the excess sold value will be counted as long-term capital gain. The accumulated depreciation will be recaptured and counted as ordinary income. Adjusting journal entries in Step 7 may be made to adjust the long-term capital gain to ordinary income.
After the asset sale, the regular depreciation expense will be reduced by an allocated amount representing the sold asset. The sale amount will be divided by the asset class life years, which will reduce the annual depreciation expense amount for the asset class. However, since these calculations are based on averages and not specific asset removal, the exact year of original acquisition of the sold asset is unknown. Therefore, the specific associated depreciation for the sold asset should be considered approximate in nature.

Question: What happens if Adjusting Journal Entries are not made to record Gain (Loss) and adjustment to Accumulated Depreciation when an Asset Sale occurs?
Answer: If Adjusting Journal Entries are not made to record Gain (Loss) and adjustment to Accumulated Depreciation when an Asset Sale occurs, all asset sales will be considered as net book value and no gain or loss will be recognized until the Asset Sale proceeds exceed the entire Asset Class value. In other words, without the necessary journal entries, the sale of the asset will not be properly accounted for and no gain or loss will be recognized until the proceeds from the sale exceed the total value of the asset class.

Question: What happens when the proceeds from an Asset Sale exceed the Gross Value of the Asset Class?
Answer: When the proceeds from an Asset Sale exceed the Gross Value of the Asset Class, several adjustments need to be made. First, the Asset Class value will be reduced to zero, and the excess sold value will be counted as Long Term Capital Gain. Additionally, Accumulated Depreciation will be recaptured and counted as Ordinary Income. Adjusting Journal Entries in Step 7 may be made to adjust the Long Term Capital Gain to Ordinary Income. 
It is important to note that if Adjusting Journal Entries are not made to record the Gain (Loss) and adjustment to Accumulated Depreciation, all asset sales will be considered as net book value, and no gain or loss will be recognized until the Asset Sale proceeds exceed the entire Asset Class value. 
Furthermore, in the years following the Asset Sale, the regular depreciation expense will be reduced by an allocated amount representing the Sold Asset. The Sale Amount will be divided by the Asset Class life years, which will reduce the annual depreciation expense amount for the Asset Class. However, since these calculations are based on averages and not specific asset removal, the exact year of original acquisition of the Sold Asset is unknown. Therefore, the specific associated depreciation for the Sold Asset should be considered approximate in nature.

Question: How is the regular depreciation expense affected in the years following an Asset Sale?
Answer: In the years following an Asset Sale, the regular depreciation expense will be reduced by an allocated amount representing the Sold Asset. The Sale Amount will be divided by the Asset Class life years, which will reduce the annual depreciation expense amount for the Asset Class. This means that the depreciation expense for the Asset Class (e.g., all assets booked as Machinery & Equipment) will be lower after the Asset Sale. It is important to note that these calculations are based on averages and not specific asset removal, so the exact year of original acquisition of the Sold Asset is unknown. Therefore, the specific associated depreciation for the Sold Asset should be considered approximate in nature.

Question: What should be considered about the specific associated depreciation for the Sold Asset?
Answer: The specific associated depreciation for the Sold Asset should be considered approximate in nature. This is because when an Asset Sale occurs, the regular depreciation expense for the years following the sale will be reduced by an allocated amount representing the Sold Asset. The Sale Amount will be divided by the Asset Class life years, which will reduce the annual depreciation expense amount for the Asset Class. However, since these calculations are based on averages and not on the specific asset removal, the exact year of original acquisition of the Sold Asset is unknown. Therefore, the specific associated depreciation for the Sold Asset should be considered approximate.
