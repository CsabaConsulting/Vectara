Question: What is the definition of working capital?
Answer: Working capital is defined as the difference between a company's current assets and current liabilities. Current assets refer to assets that are either cash or can be converted into cash within a period of 12 months from the specific date being considered. On the other hand, current liabilities include debts that are due to be paid within 12 months from the date being considered. It is important to note that current liabilities should also encompass the current portion of long-term debt, which refers to the portion of long-term debt that will be due in payments over the next 12 months. The concept of working capital is primarily used to assess a company's or a deal's ability to meet its current financial obligations, which are defined as those due within the next 12 months.

Question: What is the difference between current assets and current liabilities?
Answer: The difference between current assets and current liabilities is a key component of working capital. Current assets refer to all assets that are either cash or will be converted into cash within a 12-month period from the specific date being considered.
