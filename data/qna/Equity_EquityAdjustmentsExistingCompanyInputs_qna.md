Question: What is the purpose of the Adjustment column in the Equity section?
Answer: The purpose of the Adjustment column in the Equity section is to make adjustments to individual items or eliminate certain entries when combining companies. The column is used to add or subtract items, and the total of the column should always add up to zero. This means that for every positive number inserted for an asset, a corresponding negative number should be inserted for another asset or a positive number should be inserted for a liability. The same principle applies to liabilities. If there is no corresponding asset or liability entry, the Equity adjustment can be used. However, it is important to note that equity adjustments should only be made if absolutely necessary. If an equity adjustment is made, it may result in a Deferred Tax Liability or Deferred Tax Credit, which will be shown on the Equity adjustment line, unless the user chooses not to calculate the tax liability or credit. By selecting 'Yes' on the Equity Adjustment Input page, the income tax liability or credit for the adjustment to equity will be calculated. If 'No' is selected, no tax liability will be calculated for the Equity Adjustment.

Question: How should the total of the Adjustment column be?
Answer: The total of the Adjustment column should add up to "0". This means that for every positive number inserted for an asset, a corresponding negative number or numbers should be inserted for another asset, or a positive number should be inserted for a liability. The same principle applies to liabilities. Adding to a liability will offset adding to an asset, and vice versa. If there is no corresponding asset or liability entry, the Equity adjustment can be used. However, it is important to note that the Equity adjustment should only be used if absolutely necessary.

Question: When can the Equity adjustment be used?
Answer: The Equity adjustment can be used when there is no corresponding asset or liability entry. It should only be used if absolutely necessary. If there needs to be an equity adjustment, it can be entered on the Equity adjustment line. However, it is important to note that all equity adjustments are subject to a Deferred Tax Liability or Deferred Tax Credit, unless the user selects to not calculate the tax liability or credit on the Existing Company Initial Balance Sheet. If the user chooses not to calculate the tax liability or credit, it can be paid by a User generated Adjusting Journal Entry.

Question: What should be done if there is no corresponding asset or liability entry?
Answer: If there is no corresponding asset or liability entry, the text suggests using the Equity adjustment. However, it is important to note that the use of equity adjustments is not recommended unless absolutely necessary. If there is a need for an equity adjustment, it should be entered on the Equity adjustment line. It is also mentioned that all equity adjustments are subject to a Deferred Tax Liability or Deferred Tax Credit, unless the user chooses to override this calculation on the Existing Company Initial Balance Sheet. If the user selects "Yes" on the Equity Adjustment Input page, the tax liability will be calculated for the equity adjustment. On the other hand, if the user selects "No", no tax liability will be calculated for the equity adjustment.

Question: What is the impact on Equity after making an asset or liability adjustment?
Answer: After making an asset or liability adjustment, the impact on Equity will be shown as "Equity Adjustment Needed." This number should be entered into the Equity Adjustment Input Box, ensuring that the sign (positive or negative) is replicated for the Equity Adjustment. The goal is to make the Equity Adjustment Needed number equal to zero. 
It is important to note that if there is no corresponding asset or liability entry for the adjustment, the Equity adjustment can be used. However, it is recommended to use the Equity adjustment only if absolutely necessary. 
If an equity adjustment is made, it is subject to a Deferred Tax Liability or Deferred Tax Credit, which will be shown on the Equity adjustment line. This tax liability or credit can be calculated by selecting "Yes" on the Equity Adjustment Input page. If "Yes" is chosen, the tax liability on the adjustment will be calculated, and the actual equity change will be the net between this entry and the added Deferred Tax Liability. 
On the other hand, if "No" is selected on the Equity Adjustment Input page, no tax liability will be calculated for the Equity Adjustment. It is important to understand that most equity adjustments that come from adjusting Asset or Liability accounts will generate a Gain or Loss that will have an effect on income taxes.
