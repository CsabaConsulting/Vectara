Question: How is the Gain or Loss on the Sale of the Company calculated in ThruThink?
Answer: The Gain or Loss on the Sale of the Company in ThruThink is calculated using the Exit Sale input as a Market Value. If no Exit Input was made in Step 7, the Hard Asset Value of the Company at the end of the Horizon Period is used. The specific details of these calculations can be found in the Information Browser - Exit Calculations section. 
By default, an Equity Member will receive the same Gain/Loss percentage as their Equity percentage. However, it is possible for an Equity Member to receive a different percentage of the Gain/Loss from the Company Sale by using an override input in Step 8. This feature is designed to provide an incentive to specific equity holders such as management or investors, and it pays off upon the Sale of the Company. 
It is important to note that a Capital Gain tax calculation is used only for the ThruThink Evaluation and the Equity Return calculations. This can be found in Step 7 - Tax Rates for Capital Gain Tax input. Other tax attributes related to the Gain/Loss on the Sale of the Company are not included in the ThruThink analysis. Further information on tax calculations can be found in the Information Browser - Exit Calculations section. 
Lastly, it is worth mentioning that if there is a Loss on Sale of the Company, it will also be passed to the Equity Member in accordance with their Gain/Loss Percentage.
