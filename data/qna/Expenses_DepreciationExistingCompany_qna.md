Question: How are future depreciation expenses for existing Company assets determined?
Answer: Future depreciation expenses for existing Company assets are determined by manual input numbers entered by the User as future Existing Company Depreciation Expense Inputs. These expenses are not calculated from the asset values themselves. The User is responsible for entering the depreciation expenses for each asset category for future years. It is important to note that the depreciation expense inputs for a given asset category must be less than or equal to the asset category net value entered on the initial Existing Company Balance Sheet. If the sum of the depreciation expense inputs for a given asset category exceeds the asset category value, an error will occur and the inputs will not be allowed.
