Question: How does IRR calculate the discount rate?
Answer: The Internal Rate of Return (IRR) calculates the discount rate by finding the rate at which the Net Present Value (NPV) of the cash flows from an investment becomes zero. In other words, it determines the rate of return that makes the present value of the investment's cash inflows equal to the present value of its cash outflows.
To calculate the IRR, the cash flows associated with the investment are discounted back to their present value using different discount rates. The discount rate is adjusted until the sum of the present values of the cash inflows equals the sum of the present values of the cash outflows, resulting in an NPV of zero.
The IRR calculation involves iterating through different discount rates until the NPV is zero. This is typically done using numerical methods such as the Newton-Raphson method or trial and error. Once the discount rate is found, it represents the internal rate of return for the investment.
It is important to note that the IRR is a relative measure and is used as a comparison tool between different investment options rather than as a standalone rate of return. Additionally, the IRR calculation may default to zero in certain cases, such as when the total return is negative or the initial investment is zero or negative.

Question: How is the cash return reinvested with IRR?
Answer: With the Internal Rate of Return (IRR), the cash return is reinvested either in the initial investment or another investment with an equal return. This means that any positive cash flows generated by the investment are assumed to be reinvested at the same rate of return as the IRR. 
On the other hand, any negative annual cash shortages in the investment are assumed to be additional contributions or borrowing, which will carry a finance rate equal to the rate of return on the investment. In other words, if there are cash shortages, it is assumed that the investor will borrow money at the same rate as the IRR to cover those shortages. 
It's important to note that the IRR calculation does not reflect total negative returns well. When the total dollar return is negative (the investment less all returns is less than zero) or the initial investment is zero or negative, the IRR calculation will default to zero.

Question: What happens when the total $ return is negative or the Initial Investment is "0" or negative?
Answer: When the total $ return is negative or the Initial Investment is "0" or negative, the Internal Rate of Return (IRR) calculation will default to "0". This means that the IRR will not be calculated or reported as a positive or negative value. It is important to note that the IRR calculation does not reflect total negative returns well in these cases.

Question: What does MIRR stand for?
Answer: MIRR stands for Modified Internal Rate of Return.
---
Question: How is MIRR different from IRR?
Answer: The Modified Internal Rate of Return (MIRR) is a measure of the return on a given investment, similar to the Internal Rate of Return (IRR). However, there are some key differences between the two:
1. Reinvestment Rate: In the IRR calculation, earnings are assumed to be reinvested at the same rate as the IRR rate. On the other hand, in the MIRR calculation, earnings are reinvested at a different rate called the Reinvestment Rate. This means that the MIRR takes into account the fact that earnings may not be reinvested at the same rate as the initial investment.
2. Finance Rate: Negative cash flows from the investment are charged a Finance Rate in the MIRR calculation, which can be different from the IRR rate. This allows for the consideration of different financing costs associated with the investment.
3. Partner Equity Returns: In the context of the *ThruThink* analysis, Partner Equity Returns are measured using the MIRR rate. Cash paid out to partners is not reinvested at the IRR rate, but at the Reinvestment Rate. This is because partners may choose to use the cash received for other investments or purposes.
4. Default Reinvestment Rate: The default Reinvestment Rate in the MIRR calculation is set to "0". This means that it assumes no reinvestment of earnings. This is done because the actual reinvestment interest returns may not actually take place, and it allows for a more conservative approach in the analysis.
Overall, the MIRR provides a more flexible and realistic measure of return by considering different reinvestment rates and financing costs, while the IRR assumes reinvestment at the same rate and does not account for different financing costs.

Question: How are Partner Equity Returns measured in the ThruThink analysis?
Answer: In the ThruThink analysis, Partner Equity Returns are measured using the Modified Internal Rate of Return (MIRR) rate. The MIRR rate takes into account that cash paid out to Partners is not reinvested at the same rate as the Internal Rate of Return (IRR) rate, but at a different rate called the Re-investment Rate. 
In the analysis, Partner Returns from Equity Note repayments, as well as any Partner returns from the Seller Note and Earn Out Note payments if the Partner is the Seller, are considered as Partner Equity Returns. Additionally, Equity Draws made by the Partners are also included as Partner Equity Returns. 
The final liquidation of the Company is used as the last cash return to the Partners. The final sale or liquidation value of the Company reflects the cumulative profit/loss of the company, as well as any Gain or Loss on the Sale or liquidation.
It is important to note that with the MIRR, the actual dollar amount return over the life of the investment can be less than the initial investment, but the MIRR rate can still be positive. This occurs when the calculated re-investment return provides enough income to bring the sum of the returns plus the calculated re-investment interest income to be greater than the initial investment. However, it is important to consider that the actual re-investment interest returns may not actually take place. For this reason, the default Re-investment Rate is set to "0" in the ThruThink analysis.
Overall, the MIRR rate is used to measure Partner Equity Returns in the ThruThink analysis, taking into account the specific cash flows and reinvestment rates associated with the partners' investments.

Question: What is the default Re-investment Rate for MIRR?
Answer: The default Re-investment Rate for MIRR is set to "0".
---
Question: How can the User change the Finance Rate and Re-investment Rate for MIRR?
Answer: The User can change the Finance Rate and Re-investment Rate for MIRR by accessing the MIRR rate page through the Information Browser, specifically the MIRR Rates section. On this page, the User has the ability to modify both the Finance Rate and the Re-investment Rate. By adjusting these rates, the User can customize the MIRR calculation to reflect different assumptions about the cost of financing cash shortages and the rate at which earnings are reinvested. By default, both the Finance Rate and the Re-investment Rate are set to "0", but the User can change these values to better align with their specific analysis or investment scenario.

Question: What does the Internal Rate of Return Summary Report show?
Answer: The Internal Rate of Return Summary Report shows the Internal Rate of Return (IRR) or Modified Rate of Return (MIRR) rates for each year of the investment. It calculates the IRR/MIRR by considering the initial investment as a negative cash outlay and the subsequent year's activity (cash return for equity owners or net income for company performance) as a positive or negative annual return. The report also includes an exit value return assumption based on the sale/liquidation value of the company for each year, which is entered by the user using the Exit Strategy Input page. This report provides a comprehensive overview of the IRR/MIRR rates over the life of the investment, allowing for comparison and analysis of different investment options.

Question: What is the Hard Asset Liquidation IRR?
Answer: The Hard Asset Liquidation IRR is a measure of the return on investment in a company based on its annual net income. It calculates the Internal Rate of Return (IRR) by considering the annual net income as if it were paid out each year. At a specified year, the calculation takes into account the net balance sheet assets at book value, excluding non-cash assets like goodwill and amortization of acquisition costs. It also subtracts the amount of retained earnings (assuming they were previously paid out) and all of the company's liabilities (hard asset value). 
The Hard Asset Liquidation IRR focuses solely on the operating profitability of the company and does not include any potential gain from a sale. By excluding the market value gain on sale, it provides a measure of the company's performance based on its actual operating performance. This measure can be used to establish a benchmark return and compare it to alternative investments in other companies.
It is important to note that when the initial equity is zero or negative, the IRR result will be zero.

Question: What does the Hard Asset Liquidation IRR measure?
Answer: The Hard Asset Liquidation IRR measures the return on investment in a company based on its annual net income. It assumes that the net income is paid out each year and calculates the internal rate of return at a specific year. The calculation takes into account the balance sheet assets at book value, excluding non-cash assets like goodwill and amortization of acquisition costs. It also subtracts retained earnings (assumed to be previously paid out) and all liabilities to determine the hard asset value. This measure focuses solely on the operating profitability of the company and does not consider any potential gain on sale. It can be used as a benchmark return for comparing alternative investments in other companies. If the operating performance of the company is satisfactory, the market value gain is expected to follow accordingly.
---
Question: What does the Hard Asset Liquidation IRR exclude?
Answer: The Hard Asset Liquidation IRR excludes the non-cash assets of Goodwill and Amortization of Acquisition Costs. It also excludes any benefit from a Gain on Sale. The calculation focuses solely on the operating profitability of the Company without considering the future value of an Exit Sale.
---
Question: What is the purpose of using the Hard Asset Liquidation IRR?
Answer: The purpose of using the Hard Asset Liquidation IRR is to measure the return from the actual operating performance of a company without considering any potential gain on sale. It calculates the internal rate of return based on the investment in the company and the annual net income, assuming that the net income is paid out each year. The calculation takes into account the balance sheet assets at book value, excluding non-cash assets like goodwill and amortization of acquisition costs, and subtracts the amount of retained earnings and liabilities (hard asset value). 
By focusing solely on the operating profitability of the company and not considering any future gain on sale, the Hard Asset Liquidation IRR provides a benchmark return that can be used to compare alternative investments in other companies. It allows for a more accurate assessment of the company's performance and helps in evaluating the profitability of the company's operations. If the operating performance of the company is acceptable, it is expected that the market value gain will follow accordingly.
