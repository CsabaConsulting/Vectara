Question: What is Deferred Tax Liability generated from?
Answer: Deferred Tax Liability is generated from several factors. It is primarily generated from the difference between accrual basis tax calculations and the taxes paid, especially if taxes are calculated on a cash basis. Additionally, it is generated from the tax impact of the difference between Book Depreciation and Tax Depreciation. Deferred Tax Liability may also be generated from an Existing Company beginning balance or a User generated Adjusting Journal Entry.

Question: What happens if the Tax Depreciation is greater than the Book Depreciation?
Answer: If the Tax Depreciation is greater than the Book Depreciation, it means that the depreciation expense calculated for tax purposes is higher than the depreciation expense calculated for book purposes. This difference between the two depreciation amounts will result in certain consequences.
Firstly, on the Income Statement, the tax expense calculated on an accrual basis will be higher than the tax expense calculated on a cash basis. This is because the accrual basis tax expense uses the book depreciation, while the cash basis tax expense uses the tax depreciation. The difference between these two tax expenses will be reflected as a Deferred Tax Liability.
Secondly, on the Balance Sheet, the Deferred Tax Liability will increase. This is because the tax paid on taxable net income is less than the accrual net income due to the higher tax depreciation. The deferred tax expense generated from this difference will contribute to the increase in the Deferred Tax Liability.
However, as the Book Depreciation eventually becomes greater than the Tax Depreciation, the Tax Depreciation expense will "run out" before the Book Depreciation. This will cause the taxable net income to be greater than the accrual net income and generate more tax expense than what is shown on the Accrual Income Statement. As a result, the Deferred Tax Liability on the Balance Sheet will be reduced.
It is important to note that while a user may not enter a depreciation life for book depreciation that is less than for tax, adjustments can be made to the Deferred Tax Liability account in the Balance Sheet through Adjusting Journal Entries (AJEs). These AJEs may include a Tax Credit (negative liability) or Deferred Tax Liability.
Additionally, if the Beginning Existing Company Balance Sheet is involved, it may contain a beginning tax credit. This credit will be used on the first available tax owed. Similarly, if a tax credit is generated from an AJE, it will also be used on the first available tax owed or can be reduced by another AJE.
Lastly, if the Equity Adjustment option is used on the Beginning Existing Company Balance Sheet and the adjustment is subject to income tax, the tax paid will be Ordinary Income Tax and can be paid through a User generated Adjusting Journal Entry.

Question: How is the Deferred Tax Liability on the Balance Sheet affected when the Book Depreciation becomes greater than the Tax Depreciation?
Answer: When the Book Depreciation becomes greater than the Tax Depreciation, it results in a decrease in the Deferred Tax Liability on the Balance Sheet. This is because the Tax Depreciation expense "runs out" before the Book Depreciation, causing the Taxable net income to be greater than the Accrual Net Income. As a result, more tax expense is generated than what is shown on the Accrual Income Statement. This excess tax expense reduces the Deferred Tax Liability on the Balance Sheet.

Question: Can a depreciation life for book depreciation be less than for tax?
Answer: No, according to the given text, the user may not enter a depreciation life for book depreciation that is less than for tax. This is because it would cause a Deferred Tax Liability credit (negative liability), which is not allowed. However, the user can make Adjusting Journal Entries (AJEs) to the Deferred Tax Liability account in the Balance Sheet, which may include a Tax Credit (negative liability) or Deferred Tax Liability.

Question: What can be included in the AJE made to the Deferred Tax Liability account?
Answer: The AJE (Adjusting Journal Entry) made to the Deferred Tax Liability account can include a Tax Credit (negative liability) or Deferred Tax Liability. This means that the AJE can either decrease the Deferred Tax Liability by adding a tax credit or increase the Deferred Tax Liability by adding a deferred tax liability. The specific details of what can be included in the AJE will depend on the specific circumstances and requirements of the user.

Question: What happens if a tax credit is generated from an AJE?
Answer: If a tax credit is generated from an Adjusting Journal Entry (AJE), the credit will be used to offset the tax owed. The tax credit will be applied to the first available tax liability. Alternatively, the tax credit can be reduced or adjusted by another AJE if necessary.
---
Question: What happens if the Beginning Existing Company Balance Sheet contains a beginning tax credit?
Answer: If the Beginning Existing Company Balance Sheet contains a beginning tax credit, the credit will be used on the first available tax owed. This means that the tax credit will be applied to offset any tax liability that arises in the future. The credit will be utilized to reduce the amount of tax that needs to be paid by the company.

Question: What type of tax is paid if the User selected the adjustment to be subject to income tax?
Answer: If the User selected the adjustment to be subject to income tax, the tax that will be paid is Ordinary Income Tax. This tax can be paid by a User generated Adjusting Journal Entry.
