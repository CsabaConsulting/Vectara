Answer: If the Cash Balance is minimal or negative over a sustained period of time, the User should consider several factors. First, they should evaluate the underlying Sales/EBITDA performance of the Company. This involves analyzing the company's revenue generation and profitability. If the sales and earnings are consistently low or declining, it may indicate a fundamental issue with the business.

Lastly, the User should consider the amount of Equity in the Company. Insufficient equity could result in a lack of financial cushion and make it difficult for the company to cover its expenses. The User should assess whether additional equity investment is needed to improve the cash position.
Overall, if the Cash Balance remains minimal or negative over a sustained period, it is crucial for the User to reevaluate the company's financial performance, debt structure, and equity situation to determine if the deal structure or the deal itself is viable.

Question: What factors should be reconsidered if the deal structure or the deal itself does not make sense?
Answer: If the deal structure or the deal itself does not make sense, there are several factors that should be reconsidered. These factors include:
1. Sales/EBITDA performance of the Company: The underlying sales and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) performance of the company should be evaluated. If the company is consistently underperforming in terms of sales and profitability, it may indicate a fundamental issue with the business that needs to be addressed.
2. Debt structure: The debt structure of the company should be examined. If the company has a high level of debt or an unfavorable debt repayment schedule, it may put a strain on the cash flow and working capital requirements. Reevaluating the debt structure and potentially restructuring it may be necessary to ensure the financial viability of the deal.
3. Amount of equity: The amount of equity invested in the company should be reconsidered. If the company has insufficient equity, it may indicate a lack of financial stability and an increased risk for the deal. Increasing the amount of equity investment may be necessary to provide a stronger financial foundation for the company.
4. Combination of factors: It is important to consider a combination of factors when reassessing the deal. The sales/EBITDA performance, debt structure, and equity investment should be analyzed together to understand the overall financial health and feasibility of the deal. Adjustments may need to be made in multiple areas to ensure a more favorable outcome.
By reconsidering these factors, stakeholders can gain a better understanding of the financial risks and opportunities associated with the deal and make informed decisions regarding the deal structure or whether to proceed with the deal at all.
