Question: How is the Month Period Due calculated?
Answer: The Month Period Due is calculated based on the Effective Date and the month in which the payment is due to be received. If the Effective Date is, for example, March 31 and the payment is due in June, then the Month Period Due would be 3. The Month Period Due represents the number of months from the Effective Date to the month in which the payment is due.

Question: What happens if the Month Due is prior to month 12?
Answer: If the Month Due is prior to month 12, the total payment will remain the same, but the amount of interest income will vary. It will represent only the months of the year prior to and including the Month Due period. The remaining balance of the payment will be considered as principal and will reduce the note receivable amount accordingly. Additionally, for an entry prior to Month Period 12, accrued interest income and Accrued Interest Income Asset for the remaining periods of the year will be generated.

Question: How should accrued interest income receivable be entered for a prior existing note receivable?
Answer: For a prior existing note receivable, accrued interest income receivable should be entered as an Accrued Interest Income Receivable asset as of the beginning date in the Asset set up process. This represents the months of the year after the last payment was received in the prior year.

Question: How is the Start Month determined for a prior existing note receivable with annual payments?
Answer: For a prior existing note receivable with annual payments, the Start Month is determined based on the month in which the payment was last received in the previous year. To calculate the Start Month, add 12 to the month in which the payment was last received. 
For example, if the payment for an existing note receivable was last received in April of last year (Month 4), the Start Month would be 16 (4 + 12 months back = 16). 
This Start Month is used to determine the interest received for the 12 months after the last year's payment, which includes the periods from the prior year. The interest paid this year for the months of last year will be reversed out of the Accrued Interest Income Asset and accrued Interest Income. 
It is important to note that this calculation is applicable only for annual payments. For other payment frequencies, the Month Due will default to Month "12".

Question: What happens to the interest paid this year for the months of last year?
Answer: If interest is paid this year for the months of last year, it will be reversed out of the Accrued Interest Income Asset and credited to Interest Income. This means that the interest income received for the months of last year will be adjusted and reduced, while the Accrued Interest Income Asset will also be decreased. This adjustment is made on an accrual basis and is done automatically through an accrual entry. The specific details of these entries can be found in the Interest Income information form.

Question: What entries are made for automatic accrual of interest income?
Answer: For automatic accrual of interest income, an entry is made by debiting the Accrued Interest Income Asset and crediting the Interest Income. This entry is made for the months after the Month Period Due for each year, starting from Year 1. This accrual entry is then automatically reversed in the following year. The Interest Income information form provides more detailed information about these entries.

Question: When are the automatic accrual entries reversed?
Answer: The automatic accrual entries are reversed the following year.
