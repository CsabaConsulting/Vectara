Question: What is the purpose of the Historical Worksheet?
Answer: The purpose of the Historical Worksheet is to adjust the historical expenses of a company in order to more accurately represent its EBITDA (Earnings before Interest, Income Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization) as a standalone ongoing business in the future. The worksheet allows users to make adjustments by removing or adding items to the historical expenses. These adjustments aim to normalize the EBITDA results and provide a base for comparing future projections. The worksheet suggests specific items that should be considered for adjustment, such as removing interest, income taxes, depreciation, and amortization amounts, as well as gains or losses on the sale of assets. Other items that may be included in the adjustments are previous owner compensation, expenses that will not need to be replaced by future employees, additional labor required to replace previous owners, and extraordinary expenses or income that do not represent normal operations. It is recommended to consult with an accountant for further clarification on specific adjustments.

Question: How can the user adjust the Historical Expenses on the worksheet?
Answer: On the Historical Worksheet, the user can adjust the Historical Expenses by removing items that need to be adjusted to more accurately represent EBITDA (Earnings before Interest, Income Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization) of the company as a standalone ongoing business in the future. 
To make these adjustments, the user can enter positive numbers to add income or remove expenses that were deducted above, or negative numbers to remove income or deduct additional expenses. 
Specifically, if the Historical Expenses include Interest, Income Taxes, Depreciation, or Amortization amounts, these should be removed by entering a positive number representing those items in the Add back section. 
Additionally, any Gain or Loss on Sale of Assets should be removed for EBITDA purposes. Since Depreciation expense influences the Gain/Loss calculation and is removed for EBITDA purposes, the Gain/Loss on Sale of Assets should also be removed. If Asset Sales are considered part of the trade or business, their activity should be included as regular Sales and Cost of Goods Sold and not be depreciated. It is recommended to consult with an accountant for further clarification on this matter. 
Other items that can be included in the Add back section are previous owner compensation or expenses that will not need to be replaced by future employees (entering a positive number), or additional labor required to replace the previous owners or other unpaid or underpaid contributions (entering a negative number). 
Furthermore, adjustments can be made to remove extraordinary expenses or income that occurred in the past and are deemed to not represent normal operations. This could include extra legal or accounting expenses to prepare for a sale or to handle an unusual circumstance. 
In summary, the process of adjusting Historical Expenses aims to normalize historical EBITDA results to provide a base for comparing future projections.

Question: How should Interest, Income Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization amounts be treated in the Historical Expenses?
Answer: Interest, Income Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization amounts should be removed from the Historical Expenses entered for the Company when calculating EBITDA on the Historical Worksheet. This is because EBITDA stands for Earnings before Interest, Income Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization. To accurately represent EBITDA as a standalone ongoing business in the future, these expenses should be adjusted by entering a positive number representing those items in the Add back section. Additionally, any Gain or Loss on Sale of Assets should also be removed for EBITDA purposes, as Depreciation expense influences the Gain/Loss calculation and Depreciation is removed for EBITDA purposes. If Asset Sales are considered part of the trade or business, their activity should be included as regular Sales and Cost of Goods Sold and not be depreciated. It is recommended to consult with an accountant for further clarification on these adjustments.

Question: Should Gain or Loss on Sale of Assets be included in EBITDA calculations?
Answer: No, Gain or Loss on Sale of Assets should not be included in EBITDA calculations. The text states that for EBITDA purposes, the Gain/Loss on Sale of Assets should be removed. This is because Depreciation expense influences the Gain/Loss calculation, and since Depreciation is removed for EBITDA purposes, the Gain/Loss on Sale of Assets should also be removed. If Asset Sales are considered part of the trade or business, then their activity should be included as regular Sales and Cost of Goods Sold and not be depreciated. It is recommended to consult with an accountant for further clarification on this matter.

Question: If Asset Sales are considered part of the trade or business, how should they be treated?
Answer: If Asset Sales are considered part of the trade or business, they should be included as regular Sales and Cost of Goods Sold and not be depreciated. This means that the activity related to Asset Sales should be accounted for in the same way as other sales and associated costs, without any adjustment for depreciation. It is important to consult with an accountant for further clarification on how to treat Asset Sales in the specific context of your business.

Question: What are some examples of items that can be included in the Add back section?
Answer: Some examples of items that can be included in the Add back section are:
1. Interest Expenses: If interest expenses are included in the Historical Expenses, they should be removed by entering a positive number representing those expenses in the Add back section. This is because EBITDA is calculated before interest expenses.
2. Income Taxes: Similarly, if income taxes are included in the Historical Expenses, they should be removed by entering a positive number representing those taxes in the Add back section. EBITDA is calculated before income taxes.
3. Depreciation and Amortization: Since EBITDA is earnings before depreciation and amortization, any amounts related to these expenses contained in the Historical Expenses should be removed by entering a positive number in the Add back section.
4. Gain or Loss on Sale of Assets: For EBITDA purposes, any gain or loss on the sale of assets should be removed. This is because depreciation expense influences the gain/loss calculation, and since depreciation is removed for EBITDA purposes, the gain/loss on the sale of assets should also be removed.
5. Previous Owner Compensation: If there were any compensation or expenses paid to previous owners that will not need to be replaced by future employees, they can be included in the Add back section by entering a positive number.
6. Additional Labor: If there is a need for additional labor to replace the previous owners or other unpaid or underpaid contributions, this can be included in the Add back section by entering a negative number.
7. Extraordinary Expenses or Income: Any extraordinary expenses or income that occurred in the past and are not representative of normal operations can be included in the Add back section. This could include extra legal or accounting expenses incurred for a sale or to handle an unusual circumstance.
It is important to note that these examples are not exhaustive, and the Add back section may vary depending on the specific circumstances of the company. It is recommended to consult with an accountant for further clarification and guidance on what items should be included in the Add back section.

Question: When should adjustments be made to remove extraordinary expenses or income?
Answer: Adjustments to remove extraordinary expenses or income should be made when these items are deemed to not represent normal operations. This could include expenses or income that occurred in the past due to unusual circumstances, such as extra legal or accounting expenses incurred to prepare for a sale or to handle an unusual circumstance. The purpose of making these adjustments is to normalize historical EBITDA results and provide a base for comparing future projections.

Question: What is the purpose of normalizing historical EBITDA results?
Answer: The purpose of normalizing historical EBITDA results is to provide a base for comparing future projections. By adjusting the historical expenses, such as removing interest, income taxes, depreciation, and amortization, the EBITDA of the company can be more accurately represented as a standalone ongoing business in the future. This allows for a clearer understanding of the company's operating performance without the influence of certain expenses or income that may not be reflective of normal operations. Normalizing historical EBITDA results helps in making more informed decisions and projections for the future.
