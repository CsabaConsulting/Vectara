Question: What is Hard Asset Liquidation?
Answer: Hard Asset Liquidation refers to the process of determining the value of a company's tangible assets (Hard Assets) in a worst-case scenario. It is calculated by subtracting the non-cash assets, such as Capitalized Goodwill (the amount paid for the company over the value of actual assets) and Capitalized Acquisition Costs and other Amortized Assets, from the Net Book Value of the company's Balance Sheet (Assets less Liabilities). This value is known as Hard Asset Liquidation or HA.
The purpose of Hard Asset Liquidation is to focus solely on the operating performance of the company and does not take into account the market value of the company beyond its tangible assets. It is important to note that the worst-case value may be even lower than the Net Book Value of the Hard Assets, so users should be aware of the relationship between Net Book Value without Goodwill and the actual realizable Market Value of the company when using this measure of value.
In the context of investment comparison, Hard Asset Liquidation is used as the Exit Value. However, to remove the influence of leverage on returns, the financing type of debt is ignored in the purchase, operation, and liquidation of the company. This adjusted value is referred to as Hard Asset/No Debt or HA/ND.
For the HA/ND IRR calculation in the investment comparison process, the HA/ND Liquidation value is used as the Exit Value. It does not incorporate any of the company's debt, and the annual cash return is calculated using EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization). In this case, any Accounts Payable listed as debt on the balance sheet are subtracted from the HA/ND value because EBITDA is calculated after subtracting all expenses except Interest, Income Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization expenses. Accounts Payable reflects expenses that are already subtracted to arrive at EBITDA, so they should be assumed paid for the purpose of calculating the cash return, thereby reducing the Exit Value assets.

Question: How is Hard Asset Liquidation calculated?
Answer: Hard Asset Liquidation is calculated by taking the Net Book Value from the Balance Sheet of the Company (Assets less Liabilities) and subtracting non-cash assets such as Capitalized Goodwill, Capitalized Acquisition Costs, and other Amortized Assets. This calculation provides a worst-case valuation of the Company based solely on its tangible assets (Hard Assets). It does not take into account the market value of the Company beyond its hard asset value. It is important to note that sometimes the worst-case value may be even lower than the Net Book Value of the Hard Assets, so it is crucial for the User to understand the relationship between Net Book Value without Goodwill and the actual realizable Market Value of the Company when using this measure of value.

Question: What does Hard Asset Value focus on?
Answer: Hard Asset Value focuses on the tangible assets of a company and assumes a worst-case valuation. It does not take into account the market value of the company beyond its hard asset value. This evaluation solely considers the operating performance of the company and does not include non-cash assets such as Capitalized Goodwill and Capitalized Acquisition Costs. It is important to note that the worst-case value may be even lower than the Net Book Value of the Hard Assets, so the user should be aware of the relationship between Net Book Value without Goodwill and the actual realizable Market Value of the Company when using this measure of value.

Question: What does Hard Asset Value assume about the market value of the company?
Answer: The Hard Asset Value assumes that there is no value for the market value of the company over its hard asset value. It focuses solely on the operating performance of the company and considers only the tangible assets (hard assets) in its valuation. It is considered a worst-case valuation of the company and does not take into account any potential market value beyond the value of its tangible assets.

Question: What is Hard Asset/No Debt?
Answer: Hard Asset/No Debt (HA/ND) refers to a valuation method used for investment comparison purposes. It is a measure of the liquidation value of a company's tangible assets (Hard Assets) without considering any debt or financing. 
In the context of the HA/ND valuation, the net book value of the company's assets (excluding Goodwill) is used as the exit value. Goodwill represents the amount paid for the company over the value of its actual assets. By excluding Goodwill and debt from the valuation, HA/ND focuses solely on the tangible assets of the company.
When calculating the Internal Rate of Return (IRR) using the HA/ND method, the HA/ND liquidation value is used as the exit value. This means that the value of the company's assets, excluding Goodwill and debt, is considered as the final value upon liquidation. Additionally, the annual cash return is measured using EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization).
It is important to note that when using EBITDA as the cash return, any Accounts Payable listed as debt on the balance sheet are subtracted from the HA/ND value. This is because EBITDA is calculated after subtracting all expenses except for Interest, Income Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization expenses. Accounts Payable, which reflects expenses already subtracted to arrive at EBITDA, is assumed to be paid, reducing the value of the company's assets for the purpose of the HA/ND valuation.

Question: How is the Hard Asset/No Debt value calculated?
Answer: The Hard Asset/No Debt (HA/ND) value is calculated by taking the net book value of the assets of the company and subtracting the Goodwill. This value is used as the Exit Value in the Investment Comparison process for the HA/ND IRR calculation. It is important to note that the HA/ND value does not incorporate any of the company's debt. Additionally, when using EBITDA as the cash return, any Accounts Payable listed as debt on the balance sheet are subtracted from the HA/ND value. This is because EBITDA is calculated after subtracting all expenses except Interest, Income Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization expenses. Accounts Payable reflects expenses that are already subtracted to arrive at EBITDA, and for the purpose of calculating the HA/ND value, it should be assumed as paid, thereby reducing the Exit Value assets.

Question: What is the purpose of using Hard Asset/No Debt as the Exit Value?
Answer: The purpose of using Hard Asset/No Debt (HA/ND) as the Exit Value is to remove the influence of leverage on the returns when comparing investments. HA/ND ignores the financing type of debt in the purchase, operation, and liquidation of the company. By using HA/ND, the net book value of the assets less Goodwill is considered as the value of the company without taking into account any debt. This allows for a more accurate comparison of investments by focusing solely on the tangible assets and operating performance of the company, rather than the impact of debt on the returns.

Question: What is subtracted from the Hard Asset/No Debt value when using EBITDA as the cash return?
Answer: When using EBITDA as the cash return, the Accounts Payable listed as debt on the balance sheet are subtracted from the Hard Asset/No Debt (HA/ND) value. This is because EBITDA is calculated after subtracting all expenses except Interest, Income Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization expenses. Accounts Payable reflects expenses that are already subtracted to arrive at EBITDA, and therefore, for the purpose of calculating the HA/ND value, Accounts Payable should be assumed paid, thereby reducing the Exit Value assets.

Question: Why are Accounts Payable subtracted from the Hard Asset/No Debt value?
Answer: Accounts Payable are subtracted from the Hard Asset/No Debt (HA/ND) value because when calculating the cash return using EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization), all expenses except for Interest, Income Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization are already subtracted. Accounts Payable represents expenses that have already been accounted for in the calculation of EBITDA. Therefore, for the purpose of the HA/ND calculation, Accounts Payable is assumed to be paid, reducing the value of the assets considered in the Exit Value.
