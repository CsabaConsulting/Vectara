Question: What does the Current Date represent on the reports?
Answer: The Current Date, as displayed on the reports, represents the date and time of the last input entered by the user during the ThruThink session. If no inputs have been entered, it signifies the date and time when the project was opened in ThruThink. The Current Date is adjusted to the Pacific Time Zone, accounting for Daylight Savings Time (PDT) or Standard Time (PST) seasons. It is important to note that the Current Date is not the same as the Effective Date entered by the user in Step 2 or the Existing Company Fiscal Year End Date in Step 3. For more information, please refer to the Effective Date help topic.
