Question: What is the definition of "Inventory Weeks to Hold"?
Answer: Inventory Weeks to Hold refers to the average amount of time that inventory will be held for use. It represents the duration over which inventory will be available and ready for consumption. This metric is used to determine the amount of inventory that should be maintained in stock at any given time. The Weeks to Hold value is typically evenly distributed over the specified time period. 
The concept of Inventory Weeks to Hold is applicable to the Beginning Inventory balances. After this initial period, the input for Future Ave Weeks to Hold will be used for the subsequent Horizon Years. If no selection is made for future years, the default value will be the same as the initial input on the Transaction Sheet. If the Weeks to Hold value is left blank or set to 0, it indicates that no inventory will be held for use during that time.
In the case of an Existing Company purchasing a Target Company, a weighted average calculation is performed for Year 1. This calculation considers the Weeks to Hold values listed on the Transaction Sheet for both the Target Company and the initial input for the Existing Company. For subsequent years, the Ave Weeks to Hold values specified in the Future Input will be used without any weighted average calculation. If no selection is indicated in the Transaction Sheet, the initial input for the Existing Company will be used for future years.
The Inventory Weeks to Hold input can be found in the Inventory Set Up pages for the Transaction Sheet and the Existing Company Inventory Beginning Balances. It should be entered as a whole number, representing the number of weeks, and not as a fraction or portion of a week.
