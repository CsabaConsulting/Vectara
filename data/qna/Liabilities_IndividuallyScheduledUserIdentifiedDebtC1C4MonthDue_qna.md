Question: How is the month period due calculated?
Answer: The month period due is calculated based on the effective date and the month in which the payment is due. If the effective date is, for example, March 31 and the payment is due in June, then the month period due would be 3. The month period due represents the number of months from the effective date to the month in which the payment is due.

Question: What happens if the month due is prior to month 12?
Answer: If the month due is prior to month 12, the total payment for the debt will remain the same. However, the amount of interest will vary and only represent the months of the year prior to and including the month due period. The remaining balance of the payment will be considered as principal and will reduce the loan amount accordingly. Additionally, for an entry prior to month period 12, accrued interest income and receivable asset for the remaining periods of the year will be generated.

Question: How should accrued interest be entered for a prior existing debt?
Answer: For a prior existing debt, accrued interest should be entered as an Accrued Interest liability as of the beginning date in the Debt set up process. This represents the months of the year after the payment in the prior year. If the debt has annual payments, and the payment was last made in April of last year, for example, you would use a Month Due of 16 (April = Month 4, 4 + 12 months back = 16). This will result in 12 months of interest being paid and expensed to Interest Expense, and 8/12 of the interest paid will be reversed out or debited to Accrued Interest Liability and lower or credit Interest Expense. An automatic accrual entry will be made to credit Accrued Interest and debit Interest Expense for the months after the Month Period for each year, and this entry will be automatically reversed the following year. For more detailed information on these entries, please refer to the Interest information form.

Question: How is the start month determined for a prior existing debt with annual payments?
Answer: For a prior existing debt with annual payments, the start month is determined based on the month the payment was last paid in the previous year plus 12. 
For example, if the payment for an existing debt was last paid in April of last year (Month 4), the start month would be calculated as 4 + 12 months back, which equals 16. 
This means that if there is a payment due in April (Month 4) this year, the start month would be 16. 
It is important to note that this calculation is applicable only for annual payments and should be used when entering the month due for a prior existing debt.

Question: What happens to the interest paid for the months of last year in a prior existing debt with a month due greater than 12?
Answer: In a prior existing debt with a month due greater than 12, the interest paid for the months of last year will be reversed out of the Accrued Interest Liability and accrued Interest Expense. This means that the interest paid for the months of last year will be debited to the Accrued Interest Liability account and credited to the Interest Expense account. This reversal is done on an accrual basis and is done to accurately reflect the interest expenses for the current year. For example, if there is a payment for an existing debt due in April (Month 4) this year and was last paid in April of last year, a month due of 16 (April = Month 4, 4 + 12 months back = 16) should be used. In this case, 12 months of interest will be paid and expensed to Interest Expense, and 8/12 of the interest paid will be reversed out or debited to the Accrued Interest Liability and lower or credit Interest Expense. This ensures that the interest expenses are properly accounted for and reflects the actual interest paid for the current year.

Question: What entries are automatically made for each year after the month period?
Answer: For each year after the month period, an automatic accrual entry is made. This entry credits the Accrued Interest account and debits the Interest Expense account. This accrual entry is made at the beginning of each year and is automatically reversed the following year. The specific details of these entries can be found in the Interest information form.
---
Question: What happens to the automatic accrual entry the following year?
Answer: The automatic accrual entry made in the current year, which credits Accrued Interest and debits Interest Expense for the months after the Month Period, will be automatically reversed the following year. This means that the entry will be reversed, with the Accrued Interest liability being debited and the Interest Expense being credited. This ensures that the accruals for the previous year are properly adjusted and reflected in the financial statements for the new year. For more detailed information on these entries, you can refer to the Interest information form.
