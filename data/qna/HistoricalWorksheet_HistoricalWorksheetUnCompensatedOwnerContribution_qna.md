Question: What is the purpose of the Un-Compensated Owner Contribution on the Historical Worksheet?
Answer: The purpose of the Un-Compensated Owner Contribution on the Historical Worksheet is to account for the non-cash implied expense of the owner's time and talent contributions to the operation of the company. It is used to make the EBITDA comparison and company value indication more accurate. The Un-Compensated Owner Contribution represents the value of the owner's contributions that are critical to the company's operations and would need to be replaced if the owner were not there. This input is used as a factor in the evaluation and deal score, but it does not change the current EBITDA or add expense to the projected EBITDA. It is important to consider the value of the owner's contribution in order to properly assess the real value of the company or deal, as excluding this adjustment often results in the EBITDA value simply reflecting the owner having a "job".

Question: How is the Un-Compensated Owner Contribution defined?
Answer: The Un-Compensated Owner Contribution is defined as the time and talent contribution made by the owner of the company that is not being paid for. It is considered critical to the operation of the company and is necessary for achieving the existing EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization) as represented in the Historical Worksheet. The value of the Un-Compensated Owner Contribution should be equivalent to what would be required to replace such a contribution from an outside party. It is important to consider this contribution when assessing the real value of the company or deal, as it often gets excluded as "Owner Benefits." However, without this adjustment, the EBITDA value of the company or deal may simply reflect providing the owner a "job."

Question: What is the significance of including the value of the Un-Compensated Owner Contribution in the evaluation and deal score?
Answer: Including the value of the Un-Compensated Owner Contribution in the evaluation and deal score is significant because it helps assess the real value of the company or deal. The Un-Compensated Owner Contribution refers to the time and talent contribution of the owner that is critical to the operation of the company but is not being paid. 
By considering the value of this contribution, the evaluation and deal score can more accurately reflect the actual worth of the company or deal. Without this adjustment, the EBITDA value of the company or deal may simply reflect providing the owner a "job" rather than the true value of the business.
If the owner is making significant Un-Compensated time and talent contributions to the operation of the company, not accounting for this contribution can have a negative impact on the evaluation and deal score. Therefore, it is important to include this input as a factor in the evaluation process to properly assess the value of the company or deal.
It is worth noting that the inclusion of the Un-Compensated Owner Contribution in the evaluation and deal score does not change the current EBITDA or add expense to the projected EBITDA. It is used as a factor in the evaluation calculations to provide a more accurate assessment of the company's value.

Question: Where can the Un-Compensated Owner Contribution inputs be entered?
Answer: The Un-Compensated Owner Contribution inputs can be entered on the Un-Compensated Owner Contribution Input page. Additionally, for the ThruThink Evaluation, these inputs can be entered through the ThruThink Evaluation Additional Information page or the Quick Deal Input page. The Historical EBITDA and Projected EBITDA inputs can also reflect the Un-Compensated Owner Contribution if it is not already accounted for in the analysis.

Question: How does the Un-Compensated Owner Contribution affect the evaluation and deal score?
Answer: The Un-Compensated Owner Contribution is a non-cash implied expense that is used to make the EBITDA comparison and Company Value indication more accurate on the Historical Worksheet. It represents the value of the owner's time and talent contributions to the operation of the company that are not being paid. 
When evaluating a company or deal, if the owner is making significant Un-Compensated time and talent contributions, the value of this contribution should be considered in order to properly assess the real value of the company or deal. If there is a significant amount of Un-Compensated Owner contribution to the strategic operation of the company, it will have a negative impact on the evaluation and deal score.
The Un-Compensated Owner Contribution input is entered through the ThruThink Evaluation Additional Information page or the Quick Deal Input page. It should be a realistic assessment of the owner's contribution and is used as a factor in the evaluation. However, it does not add expense or affect the cash flow projections.
It is important to note that the Un-Compensated Owner Contribution should not be considered as the return on the owner's equity, which should be reflected separately. Additionally, both the Historical EBITDA and projected EBITDA should reflect any applicable Un-Compensated Owner Contribution for proper evaluation of the company's past and future performance.
In summary, the Un-Compensated Owner Contribution affects the evaluation and deal score by considering the value of the owner's non-paid time and talent contributions to the operation of the company. If there is a significant contribution, it will have a negative impact on the evaluation and deal score.

Question: Should the Un-Compensated Owner Contribution be considered as the return on the Owner's equity?
Answer: No, the Un-Compensated Owner Contribution should not be considered as the return on the Owner's equity. The text explicitly states that the Un-Compensated Owner Contribution is a non-cash implied expense on the Historical Worksheet and is used to make the EBITDA comparison and Company Value indication more accurate. It represents the value of the Owner's time and talent contributions to the operation of the Company that are not being paid. It is important to note that the Un-Compensated Owner Contribution should be separate from the return on the Owner's equity, which should be reflected in Step 8 of the evaluation process.
---
Question: In addition to the Un-Compensated Owner Contribution, what other inputs should be considered for proper evaluation of the Company's past and future performance?
Answer: For proper evaluation of the Company's past and future performance, in addition to the Un-Compensated Owner Contribution, the Historical EBITDA and projected EBITDA should also reflect any applicable Un-Compensated Owner Contribution. This means that if the Historical Analysis or Projected EBITDA does not reflect the value of the Owner's contribution to the Operations of the Company, an amount can be automatically added as an implied expense to the Historical Analysis or projected EBITDA in order to make the EBITDA comparison and Company Value indication more accurate.
It is important to note that the Un-Compensated Owner Contribution Inputs should be entered through the ThruThink Evaluation Additional Information page or the Quick Deal Input page. These inputs should reflect the Un-Compensated Owner Contributions that are not reflected in the current level of EBITDA as entered in Step 3. The amount entered for Un-Compensated Owner Contributions will not add expense or affect the cash flow projections but will be used as a factor in the evaluation. A significant amount of Un-Compensated Owner contribution to the strategic operation of the Company will have a negative impact on the Evaluation and Deal Score. Therefore, it is crucial to provide a realistic assessment of the Un-Compensated Owner Contributions for proper Deal evaluation.
It is also worth mentioning that the Un-Compensated Owner Contribution Inputs should not be considered as the return on the Owner's equity, which should be reflected in Step 8 of the evaluation process. The Un-Compensated Owner Contribution Inputs are specifically meant to capture the value of the Owner's time and talent contributions to the operation of the Company that are critical for achieving the existing EBITDA as represented in the Historical Worksheet.
Overall, considering the Un-Compensated Owner Contribution, Historical EBITDA, and projected EBITDA will provide a more comprehensive and accurate evaluation of the Company's past performance and future potential.

Question: Where is the Un-Compensated Owner Contribution input entered for the Historical EBITDA?
Answer: The Un-Compensated Owner Contribution input for the Historical EBITDA is entered on the Un-Compensated Owner Contribution Input page. This input is used to reflect the value of the Owner's contribution to the operations of the Company that is not being compensated. It is entered if the Historical Analysis does not already reflect the value of the Owner's contribution, and it is automatically added as an implied expense to the Historical Analysis in order to make the EBITDA comparison and Company Value indication more accurate.
