Question: What is the Payment Beginning Year option used for in the *ThruThink* analysis?
Answer: The Payment Beginning Year option in the *ThruThink* analysis is used to indicate when the payments should begin for certain debt input options. It allows for the delay of cash payments of interest and/or principal until the specified beginning year. This feature is primarily designed for the Seller Base Note, providing the option to postpone the use of cash for the Seller Base Note. In situations where a Seller Note is involved, the debt holders in senior position to the Seller Note may require the company to demonstrate sufficient performance in paying back debt senior to the Seller Note or until a substantial amount (or all) of the senior debt has been paid before allowing cash to be used to pay the Seller Note. Any unpaid Seller Note interest will be recorded as an Accrued Interest expense and become an Accrued Interest liability on the Company Balance Sheet.

Question: When do cash payments of Interest and Principal begin if the Payment Beginning Year is indicated?
Answer: If the Payment Beginning Year is indicated for a debt option in the *ThruThink* analysis, cash payments of Interest and Principal will not begin until the specified Beginning Year. This means that while interest will accrue from the initial period of the Note, the actual cash payments towards Interest and Principal will be delayed until the indicated Beginning Year. This feature is primarily designed for the Seller Base Note, allowing the option to postpone the use of cash for paying off the Seller Base Note. This is often necessary when the debt holders in senior position to the Seller Note require the company to demonstrate sufficient performance in order to repay the debt senior to the Seller Note or until a substantial amount (or all) of the senior debt has been paid. During this period of delayed cash payments, all unpaid Seller Note interest will be recorded as an Accrued Interest expense and will become an Accrued Interest liability on the Company Balance Sheet.

Question: Why is the Payment Beginning Year option designed for the Seller Base Note?
Answer: The Payment Beginning Year option is designed for the Seller Base Note because it allows for the delay of cash payments towards the Seller Base Note. In situations where a Seller Note is involved, the debt holders in senior position to the Seller Note may not allow cash to be used for paying off the Seller Note until certain conditions are met. These conditions typically include the company demonstrating sufficient performance to repay debt senior to the Seller Note or until a substantial amount (or all) of the senior debt has been paid. By delaying the cash payments for the Seller Base Note, the Payment Beginning Year option provides flexibility in managing the cash flow and meeting the requirements set by the senior debt holders.

Question: Why might cash not be used to pay the Seller Note until a certain condition is met?
Answer: Cash may not be used to pay the Seller Note until a certain condition is met because the debt holders in senior position to the Seller Note may require the company to demonstrate sufficient performance to pay back debt senior to the Seller Note or until a substantial amount (or all) of the senior debt has been paid. This condition is often imposed to ensure that the company has the financial stability and capability to meet its obligations to the senior debt holders before allocating cash towards the Seller Note. By delaying the use of cash for the Seller Note, the company can prioritize the repayment of higher-ranking debts and mitigate the risk associated with the Seller Note.

Question: What happens to the unpaid Seller Note interest on the Company Balance Sheet?
Answer: On the Company Balance Sheet, the unpaid Seller Note interest is recorded as an Accrued Interest expense and becomes an Accrued Interest liability. This means that the interest that has not been paid on the Seller Note is treated as an expense for the company and is recorded as a liability on the balance sheet. The Accrued Interest liability represents the amount of interest that has accumulated but has not yet been paid.
