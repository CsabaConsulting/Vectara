Question: What assets are typically included in the value of a company?
Answer: The assets that are typically included in the value of a company are the Equipment & Machinery of the business and inventory. Accounts Receivable may or may not be included in the value. These assets are considered necessary for the production of the income of the company and are therefore included in the valuation. However, assets that are not directly related to the operations of the company are often not valued as part of the business. These assets are valued separately, in addition to the business value.

Question: Are Accounts Receivable always included in the value of a company?
Answer: Accounts Receivable may or may not be included in the value of a company. The decision to include or exclude Accounts Receivable as part of the company's value is determined by the user on the Exit Strategy page. If the user selects "Yes" to include Accounts Receivable, then they will be considered as part of the value indicated for the company. However, if the user selects "No" to exclude Accounts Receivable, they will not be considered as part of the value, and the balance sheet value for those assets will be added to the sale or liquidation value to represent the total value of the company. It is important to note that assets that are not necessarily related to the operations of the company are often not valued as part of the business but separately, in addition to the business value.

Question: How should excluded assets be treated in the valuation of a company?
Answer: Excluded assets should be treated separately from the valuation of a company. When determining the value of a company, typically only assets that are used and necessary for the production of income are included. This includes equipment, machinery, and inventory. However, assets that are not directly related to the operations of the company are often not valued as part of the business. 
If the decision is made to exclude certain asset categories from the valuation, the "Exit Strategy" page provides an option to input "Yes or No" to include or exclude those assets. If "No" is chosen, those assets will not be considered as part of the value indicated above. Instead, the balance sheet value for those assets will be added to the sale or liquidation value to represent the total value of the company.
It is important to note that if assets such as real estate are excluded from the sale but are still used by the business, the EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization) used for the value multiple should reflect a reasonable operating expense for the fair value of the use of the excluded assets.
In summary, excluded assets are not included in the valuation of a company, but their balance sheet value may be added to the sale or liquidation value to determine the total value of the company.

Question: What should be done if real estate assets are excluded from the sale but are used by the business?
Answer: If real estate assets are excluded from the sale but are still being used by the business, it is important to reflect a reasonable operating expense for the fair value of the use of these excluded assets. This means that when calculating the EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization) used for the value multiple, an appropriate operating expense should be included to account for the fair value of utilizing the excluded real estate assets. This ensures that the financial analysis accurately reflects the impact of using these assets on the overall value of the company.

Question: What can the Adjustment Inputs on the Existing Company Balance Sheet be used for?
Answer: The Adjustment Inputs on the Existing Company Balance Sheet can be used for making adjustments or reorganizations of the Balance Sheet items. These inputs allow users to add amounts to adjust the Balance Sheet to reflect a future date, such as the effective date for the purchase of the target company. The post adjustment balances will be the only ones used in the analysis. The purpose of these adjustments is to provide a paper trail of how certain balance sheet items were adjusted to arrive at the balance used for the effective date. Additionally, these inputs can be used to demonstrate changes to balance sheet items prior to the effective date, such as the effect of a debt restructure upon the close of the transaction.
