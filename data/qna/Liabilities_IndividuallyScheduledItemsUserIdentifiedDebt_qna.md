Question: What information does the user input for each debt item?
Answer: For each debt item, the user inputs the following information:
1. Remaining Payments: The number of actual payments left for the life of the loan, up to a maximum of 240 payments. If left blank, 20 years of payments will be used.
2. Type of Payment: The user selects the type of payment from the following options:
   - 0: Interest Only with no principal paid
   - 1: Amortized-Level payment containing both principal and interest over the term of the loan
   - 2: Level Principal Payment plus Interest
   - 3: Interest Only with all of the principal paid with the last payment (balloon)
3. Payment for Amortized Loans, Principal amount for Principal plus Interest Loans: If the payment over the indicated periods is not enough to pay off principal and interest, the balance owed will be paid off in the last pay period. For the amortized payment option, if no amount is inserted, an automatic calculation based on the given factors will be used. For Level Principal plus Interest, if no principal payment amount is inserted, interest only will be calculated.
4. Number of Payments per Year: The user enters the number of payments per year, ranging from 1 to 12. If left blank, the default will be 1.
5. Month Payment is Due: This entry applies only to debt with annual payments (1 per year). For items other than annual payments, the default month due will be Month "12". The month the payment is due is the month number from the Effective Date. For example, if the Effective Date is March 31 and the payment is due in June, then the Month Period Due would be 3.
6. Year of Funding: This indicates the year the loan is funded. For the Beginning Effective Date, it can be left blank or a '0' can be entered. A '1' would indicate the loan is funded during Year 1, and so on. For monthly cash flow purposes, loan funding will be at the midpoint of the indicated year. Accrued interest for the remaining half of the year will be calculated and included in Accrued Interest Income and Accrued Interest Receivable on the Balance Sheet.
7. Funding Month: If the loan is funded during Years 1-3, the user may identify which month during those years the loan is funded. If no month is indicated, the loan will be funded in month 12 of the year indicated by default.

Question: What are the three repayment options available for each debt item?
Answer: The three repayment options available for each debt item are:
1. Interest Only: This option allows the user to make payments that only cover the interest on the loan, with no principal being paid off.
2. Amortized Level Payment: With this option, the user makes level payments that include both principal and interest over the term of the loan. The amount of each payment is calculated based on the factors provided.
3. Level Principal plus Interest: This option involves making level payments that include both principal and interest. However, if the payment over the indicated periods is not enough to pay off the principal and interest, the remaining balance owed will be paid off in the last payment period. If no principal payment amount is inserted, interest only will be calculated.

Question: What happens when the user selects "Transaction Sheet" for the "Show On" choice?
Answer: When the user selects "Transaction Sheet" for the "Show On" choice, the individual item will be sent to the Transaction Sheet. The Transaction Sheet is used for various purposes such as purchasing the target company, purchasing the existing company, or the existing company purchasing the target company. By choosing this option, the individual item will be included in the transaction and used accordingly based on the specific transaction being performed.
---
Question: What happens when the user selects "Existing Company" for the "Show On" choice?
Answer: When the user selects "Existing Company" for the "Show On" choice, the individual debt item will be sent to the Existing Company Input Section. This means that the debt item will be included in the Beginning Existing Company Balance Sheet. 
If the user is purchasing the Existing Company, sending debt to the Transaction Sheet will represent the added debt required to provide the funds for the purchase. The debt on the Transaction Sheet will be added to the Existing Company debt after the Effective Date.
In summary, selecting "Existing Company" for the "Show On" choice allows the user to include the individual debt item in the Beginning Existing Company Balance Sheet.
---
Question: What happens when the user selects "Existing Company-Adjustment" for the "Show On" choice?
Answer: When the user selects "Existing Company-Adjustment" for the "Show On" choice, the individual item will be sent to the Existing Company Input Section but placed in the Adjustment Column next to the Beginning Existing Company Inputs. This option allows the user to add debt items to the Existing Company in order to "restructure" the Beginning Existing Company debt structure.
This feature becomes useful when an existing Company Debt needs to be paid off with a new debt in accordance with a restructure plan. By selecting "Existing Company-Adjustment", the user can make changes to the debt structure before the Effective Date, and the future years will reflect the results of the debt restructure. This allows for better planning and analysis of the impact of the debt restructure on the company's financials.
In summary, selecting "Existing Company-Adjustment" for the "Show On" choice allows the user to add debt items to the Existing Company and make adjustments to the debt structure before the Effective Date, facilitating debt restructuring and providing a more accurate representation of the company's financials.

Question: What does "Year of Funding" indicate?
Answer: The "Year of Funding" indicates the year in which a loan is funded. It is used to specify when the loan is obtained or initiated. For the beginning effective date, it can be left blank or a '0' can be entered. If a '1' is entered, it indicates that the loan is funded during Year 1, and so on. 
For monthly cash flow purposes, the loan funding is assumed to occur at the midpoint of the indicated year. Accrued interest for the remaining half of the year will be calculated and included in Accrued Interest Income and Accrued Interest Receivable on the Balance Sheet.
---
Question: What happens if the "Year of Funding" is left blank?
Answer: If the "Year of Funding" is left blank, it means that the loan is not funded during any specific year. In other words, there is no specific year identified for when the loan is provided. This could indicate that the loan is already in place before the effective date or that the loan is not being funded at all. 
For monthly cash flow purposes, if the loan is funded during a specific year, it will be assumed to be funded at the midpoint of that year. Accrued interest for the remaining half of the year will be calculated and included in Accrued Interest Income and Accrued Interest Receivable on the Balance Sheet. 
It's important to note that if the loan is not funded during any year, there will be no accrued interest or any impact on the cash flow related to the loan.
---
Question: Can the user specify the month in which the loan is funded?
Answer: Yes, the user can specify the month in which the loan is funded. If the loan is funded during Years 1-3, the user may identify which month during those years the loan is funded. If no month is indicated, the loan will be funded in month 12 by default.
---
Question: What happens if the "Funding Month" is not indicated?
Answer: If the "Funding Month" is not indicated, the loan will be funded in month 12 by default.
---
Question: How many remaining payments can the user insert for the life of the loan?
Answer: The user can insert the number of actual payments left for the life of the loan up to a maximum of 240 payments. If left blank, the default is 20 years of payments.
---
Question: What are the four options for the "Type of Payment"?
Answer: The four options for the "Type of Payment" are as follows:
1. 0=Interest Only with no principal paid: This option allows the user to make payments that only cover the interest on the loan, with no reduction in the principal amount.
2. 1=Amortize-Level payment containing both principal & interest over the term of the loan: This option enables the user to make level payments that include both principal and interest, spread out over the entire term of the loan.
3. 2=Level Principal Payment plus Interest: This option allows the user to make level payments that include both principal and interest, but the principal payment remains constant throughout the term of the loan.
4. 3=Interest Only with all of the principal paid with last payment (balloon): This option allows the user to make interest-only payments throughout the term of the loan, with the entire principal amount paid off in the last payment.
---
Question: What happens if the payment for amortized loans is not enough to pay off principal and interest?
Answer: If the payment for amortized loans is not enough to pay off both principal and interest, the remaining balance owed will be paid off in the last payment period. In other words, the last payment will cover the remaining principal and interest that could not be fully paid off in the previous payments. 
For amortized payment options, if no specific payment amount is inserted, an automatic calculation based on the given factors will be used. This calculation ensures that the payment is sufficient to cover both principal and interest over the term of the loan. 
It is important to note that this information applies specifically to amortized loans. For loans with a different payment structure, such as interest-only or level principal plus interest, different rules and calculations may apply.
---
Question: What happens if no payment amount is inserted for "Level Principal plus Interest" loans?
Answer: If no payment amount is inserted for "Level Principal plus Interest" loans, the system will automatically calculate the interest-only payment. In other words, the payment will only cover the interest portion of the loan, and no principal will be paid off.
---
Question: What is the default number of payments per year if left blank?
Answer: If the "Number of Payments per Year" field is left blank, the default value will be 1 payment per year.
---
Question: What does the "Month Payment is Due" entry apply to?
Answer: The "Month Payment is Due" entry applies to debt with annual payments (1 per year). For items other than annual payments, the default value for the Month Due will be Month "12". 
The Month the payment is due is determined based on the Month # from the Effective Date. For example, if the Effective Date is March 31 and the payment is due in June, then the Month Period Due would be 3. 
If the Month Due is prior to month 12, the total payment will remain the same, but the amount of interest will vary and represent only the months of the year prior to and including the Month Due period. The remaining balance of the payment will be considered as principal and will reduce the loan amount accordingly.
For prior existing debts with annual payments, if the Month Due is greater than 12, the Start Month is the month the payment was last paid last year plus 12. The interest paid will be for the 12 months after last year's payment, which will include the periods from the prior year. On an accrual basis, interest paid this year for the months of last year will be reversed out of Accrued Interest Liability and accrued Interest expense. 
In summary, the "Month Payment is Due" entry is used to determine the specific month in which the payment is due for debt with annual payments.
---
Question: What is the default month due for items other than annual payments?
Answer: For items other than annual payments, the default month due is Month "12".
---
Question: How is the month period due calculated?
Answer: The month period due is calculated based on the effective date and the specified month for the payment. If the effective date is, for example, March 31 and the payment is due in June, then the month period due would be 3. 
For entries prior to month period 12, accrued interest income and receivable asset for the remaining periods of the year will be generated. If the month due is prior to month 12, the total payment will stay the same, but the amount of interest will vary and represent only the months of the year prior to and including the month due period. The balance of the payment will be principal and reduce the loan amount accordingly.
If this is a prior existing debt with annual payments only, and the month due is greater than 12, the start month is the month the payment was last paid last year plus 12. The interest paid will be for the 12 months after last year's payment, which will include the periods from the prior year. On an accrual basis, interest paid this year for the months of last year will be reversed out of accrued interest liability and accrued interest expense. 
For example, if there is a payment for an existing debt due in April (month 4) this year and it was last paid in April of last year, use a month due of 16 (April = month 4, 4 + 12 months back = 16). 12 months of interest will be paid and expensed to interest expense, and 8/12 of the interest paid will be reversed out or debited to accrued interest liability and lower or credit interest expense. 
An automatic accrual entry will be made crediting accrued interest and debiting interest expense for the months after the month period for each year beginning with year 1. This input is then automatically reversed the following year.

Question: What happens if the month due is prior to month 12?
Answer: If the month due is prior to month 12, the total payment will remain the same, but the amount of interest will vary and represent only the months of the year prior to and including the month due period. The remaining balance of the payment will be considered as principal and will reduce the loan amount accordingly. 
For example, if the effective date is March 31 and the payment is due in June, the month period due would be 3. In this case, the interest portion of the payment will only cover the months of January, February, and March. The remaining portion of the payment will be considered as principal and will be used to reduce the loan amount.
It is important to note that for prior existing debts with annual payments, if the month due is greater than 12, the start month will be the month the payment was last paid in the previous year plus 12. The interest paid will cover the 12 months after the last year's payment, including the periods from the prior year. On an accrual basis, the interest paid in the current year for the months of the previous year will be reversed out of the accrued interest liability and will be debited to interest expense.

Question: How should accrued interest for prior existing debt be entered?
Answer: For prior existing debt, accrued interest should be entered as an Accrued Interest liability as of the beginning date in the Debt setup process. This represents the months of the year after the payment in the prior year. 
If this is a prior existing debt with annual payments, and the Month Due is greater than 12, the Start Month is the month the payment was last paid last year plus 12. The interest paid will be for the 12 months after last year's payment, which will include the periods from the prior year. 
On an accrual basis, interest paid this year for the months of last year will be reversed out of Accrued Interest Liability and accrued Interest expense. For example, if there is a payment for an existing debt due in April (Month 4) this year and was last paid in April of last year, use a month due of 16 (April = Month 4, 4 + 12 months back = 16). 
12 months of interest will be paid and expensed to Interest Expense, and 8/12 of the interest paid will be reversed out or debited to Accrued Interest Liability and lower or credit Interest Expense. 
An automatic accrual entry will be made crediting Accrued Interest and debiting Interest Expense for the months after the Month Period for each Year beginning with Year 1. This input is then automatically reversed the following year.

Question: What should be inputted for the month due if it is a prior existing debt with annual payments?
Answer: If it is a prior existing debt with annual payments, the month due should be greater than 12. The start month should be the month the payment was last paid last year plus 12. For example, if there is a payment for an existing debt due in April (Month 4) this year and was last paid in April of last year, the month due should be 16 (April = Month 4, 4 + 12 months back = 16). This ensures that 12 months of interest will be paid and expensed to Interest Expense, and 8/12 of the interest paid will be reversed out or debited to Accrued Interest Liability and lower or credit Interest Expense.
---
Question: How is the start month calculated for a prior existing debt with a month due greater than 12?
Answer: For a prior existing debt with a month due greater than 12, the start month is calculated based on the month the payment was last paid last year plus 12. 
Here's an example to illustrate this calculation:
If there is a payment for an existing debt due in April (Month 4) this year and it was last paid in April of last year, the start month would be calculated as follows:
Month due: 16 (April = Month 4, 4 + 12 months back = 16)
In this case, 12 months of interest will be paid and expensed to Interest Expense, and 8/12 of the interest paid will be reversed out or debited to Accrued Interest Liability and lower or credit Interest Expense.
An automatic accrual entry will be made crediting Accrued Interest and debiting Interest Expense for the months after the Month Period for each year beginning with Year 1. This input is then automatically reversed the following year. Please refer to the Interest information form for the detailed breakdown of these entries.

Question: What happens to the interest paid for the months of last year in a prior existing debt with a month due greater than 12?
Answer: If there is a prior existing debt with annual payments and the month due is greater than 12, the start month is the month the payment was last paid last year plus 12. The interest paid will be for the 12 months after last year's payment, which will include the periods from the prior year. 
On an accrual basis, the interest paid this year for the months of last year will be reversed out of the Accrued Interest Liability and accrued Interest expense. For example, if there is a payment for an existing debt due in April (Month 4) this year and was last paid in April of last year, use a month due of 16 (April = Month 4, 4 + 12 months back = 16). 
12 months of interest will be paid and expensed to Interest Expense, and 8/12 of the interest paid will be reversed out or debited to Accrued Interest Liability and lower or credit Interest Expense. 
An automatic accrual entry will be made crediting Accrued Interest and debiting Interest Expense for the months after the Month Period for each Year beginning with Year 1. This input is then automatically reversed the following year.
