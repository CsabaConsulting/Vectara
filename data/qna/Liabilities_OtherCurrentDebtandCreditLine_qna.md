Question: What is the purpose of the General Other Current Debt input on the Transaction Sheet and Existing Company Debt input page?
Answer: The purpose of the General Other Current Debt input on the Transaction Sheet and Existing Company Debt input page is to record general miscellaneous debts that are due within 12 months. This category allows for the input of a general amount for debts that do not require specific individual loan details. The General Other Current Debt portion is combined from inputs in Step 6 for both the Transaction Sheet and the Existing Company. It is important to note that the General Other Current Debt will be paid off at the end of the then current year unless a Credit Limit is specified. If a Credit Limit is provided, the General Other Current Debt will roll into a Credit Line facility with automatic draws and payments to the cash account.

Question: How does the Credit Line feature work for Other Current Debt?
Answer: The Credit Line feature for Other Current Debt allows for automatic draws and payments to cover shortages or surpluses in the cash general account. To activate the Credit Line feature, a Credit Limit amount needs to be entered in Step 6. 
If the Credit Limit input is left blank or set to '0', the General Other Current Debt portion will be paid off at the end of the current year. 
If the Credit Limit is greater than '0', on a weekly basis, there will be automatic draws to the Other Current Debt throughout years 1-3 up to the amount of the Credit Limit to cover shortages in the cash general account. If there is a surplus in the cash general account, automatic payments will be made to the Other Current Debt Credit Line up to the amount of the outstanding balance of the Credit Line. This works similar to a sweep feature for a credit line with a bank. 
The interest for the General Other Credit/Credit Line amounts is paid monthly. 
The Credit Limit amount will carry forward to all successive years unless changed by the user with an annual Credit Limit input for each year on the Other Current Debt page. Any future annual Credit Limit input will automatically carry forward to all successive years unless changed in future years by the user. 
To turn off the Credit Line feature, the Credit Limit input should be left blank or set to '0'.

Question: How can the 12 Month Anniversary Payoff payment month be changed for Individually Scheduled Other Current Loans?
Answer: To change the 12 Month Anniversary Payoff payment month for Individually Scheduled Other Current Loans, negative amounts can be used. This should only be done when the Renewal is set to 'No' for the year involved. Here are the steps to change the payment month:
1. By default, the payoff for each Individually Scheduled Other Current Loan will be paid off (unless renewed) in the next year (Payoff Year), 12 months after the Funding Month.
2. If the payoff needs to be earlier in the Payoff Year, enter a negative loan amount for the payoff in the month needed and enter the Payoff Year as the Funding Year. Also, enter 'Move' in the Description Field for that amount.
3. Enter another corresponding positive amount in the 12 month anniversary month in the Payoff Year for the original loan amount. Again, enter 'Move' in the Description Field for that entry as well.
4. This effectively moves the payoff from the original 12 month anniversary month to the new required month in the Payoff Year. Remember, this option should only be used when the Renewal is set to 'No' for the year with the negative amounts.
5. If the payoff needs to be later in the same year as the Funding Year and not in the Succeeding Year, enter a negative loan amount for the payoff in the month needed (must be after the Funding Month of the original loan) for the Funding Year. Enter 'Move' in the Description Field for that amount.
6. Enter a positive amount in the 12 month anniversary month of the original loan in the Succeeding Year. Again, enter 'Move' in the Description Field for that entry as well.
7. This effectively moves the payoff from the original 12 month anniversary month to the new required month in the same year as the Funding Year. Remember, this option should only be used when the Renewal is set to 'No' for the year with the negative amounts.
8. It is important to enter 'Move' in the Description Field for both the positive and negative adjustment amounts when entering negative amounts to move the payment month.
Please note that these adjustments should be made carefully, and it is recommended to double-check the entries to ensure the desired effect on cash flow.

Question: How does the Credit Limit input affect the annual renewal of the General Other Current Debt?
Answer: The Credit Limit input plays a significant role in the annual renewal of the General Other Current Debt. If the Credit Limit input is left blank, the General Other Current Debt will remain constant throughout Year 1 and will be paid off in Month 12 of Year 1. However, if the Credit Limit input for the General Other Current Debt is set to '0', the General Other Current Debt amount will be paid off in Month 1 of Year 1.
On the other hand, if the Credit Limit input for any given year is greater than '0', it indicates that the Credit Line feature is active. In this case, the Credit Line will be renewed annually, and there will be automatic draws and payments to the Other Current Debt Credit Line based on the Credit Limit amount. The auto Advance/Pay feature will be active within the parameters of the Credit Limit. The annual Credit Limit inputs can be found on the Other Current Debt page.
It is important to note that the General Other Current Debt portion will be represented on the Balance Sheet under Current Debt, even if it is renewed every year. It will always be considered due within 12 months.

Question: What is the Non Interest Bearing Portion of Other Current Debt?
Answer: The Non Interest Bearing Portion of Other Current Debt refers to miscellaneous debts that are due within twelve months and do not accrue any interest. These debts are considered short-term liabilities and are reported under the category of Other Current Debt on the Balance Sheet. The initial balance of this category may come from the total Other Current Debt imported from other projects, although this feature is not currently available. 
Specific increases or decreases to the Non Interest Bearing Portion of Other Current Debt can be made through Adjusting Journal Entries for each year of the Horizon. Increases made on the Cash Flow Control page that exceed the Credit Limit of Other Current Debt will increase this category, while decreases in the Other Current Debt category from the Cash Flow Control page that exceed the outstanding balances of the General or Individually Scheduled Other Current Debt will decrease this category.
It is important to note that any Adjusting Journal Entry made to this account after the Effective Date will directly affect cash, but it will have no effect on income/expenses or tax calculations, whether on a cash basis or accrual basis. Therefore, the user needs to be cautious and ensure that the intended effect on cash is desired. In some cases, an Adjusting Journal Entry to another account with the opposite sign may need to be made to offset the cash effect. The cash flow impact of these adjustments will be reflected in the Non Expense Adjusting Journal Entry cash flow line item in the Cash Flow Control form.

Question: What caution should be taken when making an Adjusting Journal Entry to the Other Current Debt account?
Answer: When making an Adjusting Journal Entry to the Other Current Debt account, caution should be taken because it will directly affect cash but will have no effect on income/expenses or tax calculations, whether on a cash basis or accrual basis. This means that any adjustment made to the Other Current Debt account will impact the cash flow but will not affect the financial statements or tax calculations in terms of income or expenses. 
Therefore, it is important for the user to carefully consider the intended effect on cash when making an AJE to the Other Current Debt account. If the user wants to offset the cash effect, they may need to make an AJE to another account with the opposite sign to balance out the cash impact. 
The cash flow impact resulting from the AJE to the Other Current Debt account will be reflected in the Non Expense Adjusting Journal Entry cash flow line item in the Cash Flow Control form.
