Question: How many methods can be used to enter Overhead Operating Expenses in the *ThruThink* analysis?
Answer: In the *ThruThink* analysis, there are three methods that can be used to enter Overhead Operating Expenses. These methods include:
1. Percentage of Sales: Overhead Operating Expenses can be entered as a percentage of Sales in the Step 3 Inputs. This allows for a proportional allocation of expenses based on the level of sales.
2. Override Input: Overhead Expenses can also be entered using an Override input on the Cash Flow Control page. This allows for a manual adjustment of expenses, overriding the percentage of Sales method.
3. Individual Item Amounts: Overhead Expenses can be entered by specifying individual item amounts using the Overhead Expense Adjustment Input page. This method allows for a more detailed and specific allocation of expenses.
It is important to note that Overhead Operating Expenses include general operating expenses, non-specific marketing and sales expenses, and general and administrative overhead that do not necessarily vary directly with the amount of product sold. These expenses may increase in a stair-step manner, where they stay level within a certain range of sales and then increase to a new level. If expressing these expenses as a percentage of Sales becomes challenging due to significant changes in sales from year to year, the Cash Flow Control allows the user to input summary whole numbers for each individual year.

Question: Why might it be difficult to express this type of expense with a percentage of Sales?
Answer: It might be difficult to express this type of expense with a percentage of Sales if sales change significantly from year to year. This is because the expenses associated with overhead operating expenses may increase in a stair-step manner as product is sold. In other words, the expenses will remain at a certain level within a range of sales and then increase to a new level. If sales change significantly from year to year, it becomes challenging to accurately represent this type of expense using a fixed percentage of Sales. In such cases, the Cash Flow Control feature allows the user to input summary whole numbers for each individual year, providing a more flexible and accurate representation of the overhead expenses.
