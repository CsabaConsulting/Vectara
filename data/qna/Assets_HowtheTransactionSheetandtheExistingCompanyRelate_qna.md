Question: How should the Debt and Equity required to acquire the Existing Company be entered?
Answer: When acquiring the Existing Company, the Debt and Equity needed for the acquisition should be entered using the Transaction Sheet options. This includes both new acquisition debt and new Existing Company debt (after the Effective Date). If there are assets at the Existing Company that can be utilized for additional debt after the Effective Date, this additional debt should be entered on the Transaction Sheet. The proceeds from this debt, as well as any Equity Debt or Contributions from outside Equity, will become part of the capital structure assembled to acquire the Existing Company. After the acquisition, all the debt and equity from both the Transaction Sheet and the Existing Company will be consolidated into the post-closing Balance Sheet.

The specific details of the debt and equity, including any additional debt raised by the Existing Company or the Target Company, as well as equity contributions from outside equity groups, can be viewed on the Information Tab Transaction Views through the Transaction Deal Structure and Transaction Buyers and Sellers Statement.

Question: What options are used on the Transaction Sheet when the Existing Company is purchasing the Target Company?
Answer: When the Existing Company is purchasing the Target Company, the options used on the Transaction Sheet are as follows:
1. Target Company Information: The Transaction Sheet option is used to enter the relevant information about the Target Company, including its Sales and EBITDA, in Steps 3, 5, and 6.
2. Existing Company Information: The Existing Company option is used to enter the information about the Existing Company, including its Sales, EBITDA, Assets, and Liabilities, in Steps 3, 5, and 6.
3. Equity Partner Groups: The Existing Company must be listed as one of the Equity Partner Groups through the Equity inputs in Step 8. This is where the Equity Structure for the purchase is entered, and any cash required from the Existing Company as an Equity Group will be taken from the cash listed on the Existing Company Input page.
It is important to note that if there is not enough cash in the Existing Company's balance sheet, any cash contribution from the Existing Company Equity Group above the cash shown on the Existing Company Balance Sheet will not be allowed as a cash input on the Transaction Sheet Equity input.
Additionally, care should be taken to avoid duplicating Sales or EBITDA information between the Target Company and the Existing Company, as both sets of information will become the base information going forward as of the close of escrow or the Effective Date.
