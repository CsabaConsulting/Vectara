Question: What does the Part 1 of the Individually Scheduled Section D Income form record?
Answer: Part 1 of the Individually Scheduled Section D Income form records the sales of Individually Scheduled Inventory that is used in Section B. It indicates when the inventory is to be sold during the year. The Sale Value in this section represents the gross income generated from the inventory that was indicated as 'used' in the Individually Scheduled Section B Inventory Use page. If the inventory is of the Work in Process type, where it consists of individual parts of a final product, the Sale Value can be either left as '0' or the page can be exited. In such cases, the Sale Value of the finished product can be entered individually in Section D - Scheduled Income.
