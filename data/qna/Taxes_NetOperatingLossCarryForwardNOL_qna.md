Question: What is a net operating loss carry forward (NOL)?
Answer: A net operating loss carry forward (NOL) is a tax loss that occurs in one year and can be carried forward to future years to offset taxable income. This means that if a company experiences a net operating loss in a particular year, it can use that loss to reduce its taxable income in future years. The NOL can be applied against both federal and regional taxable net income in the analysis. It is important for the user to consult with their accountant or tax preparer to ensure that the NOL will be available and applicable to the entity's future taxable net income. When entering an NOL amount, a corresponding input for the asset value of the NOL should be made by entering a negative number for the beginning Deferred Tax Liability balance. This negative liability acts as an asset and is considered a tax credit against future years' net income for tax calculation purposes. The NOL is applied against the next year's positive net income, reducing the actual taxes owed for that year and succeeding positive net income years until it is completely used. For cash flow purposes, estimated tax payments are made on a quarterly basis during the taxable year, and actual taxes are calculated and paid in the following year with a credit taken for the estimated payments made during the taxable year. The NOL is also reflected in the income statement, where the deferred tax asset is reduced and expensed as a non-cash deferred tax expense. At the end of the taxable year, there may be an income tax liability for the difference between the taxes owed and the estimated tax payments made during the year. Similarly, any losses incurred during the horizon years can also be carried forward and applied to net income in subsequent years. The input for the NOL can be found on the Tax Rate Input page.

Question: How can the NOL be utilized in the analysis?
Answer: The NOL (Net Operating Loss) can be utilized in the analysis to reduce future taxable income. It is a carry forward tax loss from previous years that can be applied to offset positive net income in future years. 
To utilize the NOL in the analysis, the user should provide the NOL amount to their accountant or tax preparer. The user should also ensure that the NOL will actually be available and applicable to the entity's future taxable net income as represented in the projections.
In the analysis, the NOL will apply to both Federal and Region taxable net income. It will be applied against the next year of positive net income (Taxable Year), thereby reducing the actual taxes owed for that year and succeeding positive net income years until completely used.
For tax payment purposes, estimated tax payments are made on a quarterly basis during the Taxable Year in Period 4, 6, 9, and 12. The actual taxes are then calculated for the Taxable Year and paid in Period 4 of the following year, taking into account the estimated payments made during the Taxable Year.
From a cash flow perspective, the NOL reduces the taxes owed, resulting in lower tax payments in the Taxable Year. However, from an accrual point of view, the Income Statement for the Taxable Year will still show a tax expense for the Taxes Owed (reduced by the NOL) and a Deferred Tax expense to reflect the write-off of the Tax Credit asset in the Taxable Year.
At the end of the Taxable Year, there may be an Income Tax Liability for the difference between the Taxes Owed and the estimated tax payments made during the Taxable Year.
Additionally, any losses incurred during the Horizon Years (future years) can also be carried forward and applied to net income in subsequent years.
To input the NOL amount, the user can find the input field on the Tax Rate Input page. It is important to enter a corresponding input for the asset value of the NOL by entering a negative number for the beginning Deferred Tax Liability balance in Step 6. This negative liability will act as an asset and be considered a Tax Credit against future years' net income for tax calculation purposes.

Question: How should the NOL amount be entered?
Answer: The NOL amount should be entered as a negative number in the beginning Deferred Tax Liability balance in Step 6. This negative liability will be treated as an asset and considered a Tax Credit against future years' net income for tax calculation purposes. Additionally, a corresponding input for the asset value of the NOL (NOL multiplied by a tax rate) should be made. This will help calculate the value of the NOL as an asset.

Question: Which income does the NOL apply to in the analysis?
Answer: In the analysis, the NOL (Net Operating Loss) applies to both Federal and Region taxable net income. It can be carried forward from previous years and applied to future years to reduce future years' taxable income.

Question: How does the NOL affect tax payments?
Answer: The Net Operating Loss Carry Forward (NOL) can affect tax payments by reducing the amount of taxes owed in future years. When an NOL is applied, it is used to offset positive net income in the next year (Taxable Year) and subsequent positive net income years until it is completely used. This means that the NOL reduces the actual taxes owed for those years.
For cash flow purposes, estimated tax payments are made on a quarterly basis during the Taxable Year. These payments are made in Period 4, 6, 9, and 12 of the Taxable Year. The actual taxes owed for the Taxable Year are calculated and paid in Period 4 of the following year, taking into account the estimated payments made during the Taxable Year.
In terms of accounting, the Deferred Tax asset, which represents the NOL, is reduced and expensed as a non-cash Deferred Tax Expense on the Income Statement for the Taxable Year. This means that the Income Statement will show a tax expense for the Taxes Owed (which was reduced by the NOL) as well as a Deferred Tax expense to reflect the write-off of the Tax Credit asset in the Taxable Year.
At the end of the Taxable Year, there may be an Income Tax Liability, which represents the difference between the Taxes Owed and the estimated tax payments made during the Taxable Year.
It is important to note that the availability and application of the NOL should be confirmed by the user's accountant or tax preparer, and the NOL should be entered in the appropriate input field on the Tax Rate Input page. The NOL applies to both Federal and Region taxable net income in the analysis.

Question: When are estimated tax payments made during the taxable year?
Answer: Estimated tax payments are made during the taxable year on a quarterly basis. Specifically, these payments are made in Period 4, 6, 9, and 12 of the taxable year.
---
Question: When are actual taxes calculated and paid?
Answer: Actual taxes are calculated and paid in the Taxable Year. Estimated tax payments are made on a quarterly basis during Period 4, 6, 9, and 12 of the Taxable Year. These estimated payments are credited towards the actual taxes owed for the Taxable Year. The actual taxes owed for the Taxable Year are then calculated and paid in Period 4 of the following year, taking into account the estimated payments made during the Taxable Year.
---
Question: How is the Deferred Tax asset affected in the taxable year?
Answer: In the taxable year, the Deferred Tax asset is reduced and expensed as a non-cash Deferred Tax Expense on the Income Statement. This means that the value of the Deferred Tax asset is decreased and recorded as an expense on the company's financial statements. The reduction in the Deferred Tax asset reflects the write-off of the Tax Credit asset in the taxable year. This adjustment is made to accurately reflect the impact of the Net Operating Loss Carry Forward (NOL) on the company's tax liability and financial performance.

Question: What is the Income Tax Liability at the end of the taxable year?
Answer: The given text does not explicitly mention the specific calculation or value of the Income Tax Liability at the end of the taxable year. However, it does mention that at the end of the taxable year, there will be an Income Tax Liability for the difference between the Taxes Owed and the estimated tax payments made during the taxable year. This suggests that the Income Tax Liability is the amount of taxes owed for the taxable year after accounting for any estimated tax payments made throughout the year. To determine the exact value of the Income Tax Liability, additional information or calculations would be required.

Question: How are losses incurred during the Horizon Years treated?
Answer: Losses incurred during the Horizon Years are treated in the same manner as the initial Net Operating Loss (NOL). They can be carried forward and applied to the Net Income in the subsequent years. This means that if a company incurs losses during the Horizon Years, those losses can be used to offset future taxable income, thereby reducing the amount of taxes owed in those years. The specific details and calculations related to the treatment of these losses can be found on the Tax Rate Input page. It is important to note that the availability and application of these losses should be confirmed by the user's accountant or tax preparer to ensure that they will be applicable to the entity's future taxable net income as represented in the projections.
