Question: How can Accounts Receivable and Inventory be used as collateral for credit lines?
Answer: Accounts Receivable and Inventory can be used as collateral for credit lines. This can be enabled by checking the applicable check box(s) in the Accounts Receivable and Inventory sections of the Cash Flow Control page. Once these boxes are checked, the credit lines become available and can be used. The Leverage Ratios, Loan Reserve, and Interest Rates specified in the Accounts Receivable Future Terms Set-up and/or Inventory Future Terms Set-Up tables will be used for these credit lines.
The credit lines will automatically draw and payoff (sweep) between the credit lines and the cash account on a weekly basis. The limit on these credit lines is determined by the Leverage Ratio and the Loan Reserve amounts. There is an overall maximum limit input for each credit line, but the default for this input is blank. A blank input means that there is no maximum limit for these loans.
To establish the overall maximum requirements with the lender, the monthly peak amounts for these credit lines can be found in the Annual Budget Report. These peak amounts can be used to determine the appropriate maximums. Once the maximums are determined, an input for the overall maximum can be entered for the Accounts Receivable and Inventory Lines of Credit in their respective Future Terms Set-Up tables.
