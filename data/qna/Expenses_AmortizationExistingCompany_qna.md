Question: How is the future amortization expense calculated for the existing company?
Answer: The future amortization expense for the existing company is not calculated automatically based on the beginning asset value. Instead, it is a manual input number entered by the user as a future existing company amortization expense input. The user is responsible for determining and entering the desired future amortization expense for the amortized asset category. However, it is important to note that the entered amortization expense for future years must be less than or equal to the asset category net value entered on the initial existing company balance sheet. If the sum of the entered amortization expenses exceeds the asset category value, an error will occur, and the input will not be allowed.
