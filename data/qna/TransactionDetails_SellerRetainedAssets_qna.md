Question: What is Seller Retained Assets?
Answer: Seller Retained Assets refers to a situation in which the seller of a company chooses to retain ownership of certain assets that are typically included in the overall value of the company being sold. This option is available during the process of entering the purchase price for the company. It can be used when the buyer is unable to offer the seller the desired sale price or when there is a disagreement between the seller and the buyer regarding the value of certain assets.
When the seller chooses to retain assets, they can lease these assets back to the company after the sale is completed. This allows the buyer to agree to a lease rate that is in line with the contribution value of the assets. The value of the retained assets will be subtracted from the overall value indicated for the company. The remaining value can still be used as the company value, and the amount indicated with the Seller Retained Assets input will reduce the value by the amount retained by the seller.
In the debt input section, there is a provision to lease assets back from the seller if applicable. By including the seller's assets in the gross value and then subtracting them out, the buyer and seller can accurately reflect the full benefit of the business value plus the retained assets to the seller in the sale statement on the transaction sheet.
It is important to note that the option to retain assets only applies in certain circumstances, and the Seller Retained Assets input may be left blank if this option is not desired.

Question: What does including Seller assets in the gross value and then subtracting them out achieve?
Answer: Including Seller assets in the gross value and then subtracting them out achieves two main objectives. 
Firstly, it allows the Buyer and Seller to accurately reflect the full benefit of the business value plus the retained assets to the Seller in the Sale Statement on the Transaction Sheet. By including the value of the Seller's retained assets in the initial calculation of the Company value, the Sale Statement will provide a comprehensive overview of the total value of the business and the assets retained by the Seller.
Secondly, this approach provides a solution in situations where the Buyer is unable to offer the Seller the desired sale price or when there is a disagreement between the Seller and the Buyer regarding the value of certain assets. By allowing the Seller to retain ownership of specific assets and lease them back to the Company after the sale, the Buyer can agree to a lease rate that is commensurate with the contribution value of those assets. This arrangement enables the Seller to maintain control over valuable assets while still benefiting from the sale of the Company.
It is important to note that including Seller assets in the gross value and subtracting them out is an optional input and only applies in certain circumstances. If this option is not desired or applicable, the Seller Retained Assets Input may be left blank.
