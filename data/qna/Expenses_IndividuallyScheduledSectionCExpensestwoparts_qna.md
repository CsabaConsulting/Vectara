Question: What will happen when an entry is made in the form?
Answer: When an entry is made in the form, a pop-up will appear giving the user the option to capitalize a portion or all of the expense entered to the following year. The capitalized expense will be treated as inventory in the current year until the specified period in the next year when it will be expensed. The pop-up page will allow the user to designate a month and sale value in the next year for the capitalized inventory. Each time an entry is made, the user will be prompted with a new pop-up page to determine the capitalization amount and next year's month and sale value. If there is an existing capitalized amount for the item, it will be shown on the prompt and the user can choose to change or accept that amount. If there is no capitalized amount, the user must enter '0'. The capitalized inputs will be recorded on the Individually Scheduled Section C Capitalized Expense page, while the un-capitalized portion of the expenses will be entered as expenses under Cost of Goods Sold.

Question: What options will be presented to the user in the Pop Up page?
Answer: In the Pop Up page, the user will be presented with the following options:
1. Capitalize all: The user can choose to capitalize the entire expense entered to the following year. This means that the expense will become inventory in the current year until it is indicated to be expenses in the next year.
2. Capitalize a portion: The user can choose to capitalize only a portion of the expense entered to the following year. This allows for a partial amount of the expense to become inventory in the current year until it is indicated to be expenses in the next year.
3. Do not capitalize: The user can choose not to capitalize any portion of the expense entered. In this case, the entire expense will be recorded as an expense under Cost of Goods Sold in the current year.
Additionally, the Pop Up page will also allow the user to designate a specific month and sale value in the next year for the capitalized inventory to be used and the value at which it will be sold. The user will have the option to change or accept the existing capitalized amount for the item, if applicable. If there is no capitalized amount, the user must enter '0' for the capitalized amount.
