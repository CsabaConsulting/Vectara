Question: What is the purpose of capitalizing expenses?
Answer: The purpose of capitalizing expenses is to match income against the proper expense associated with that income in the period that the income occurs. This process involves removing direct expenses incurred in one period for items sold in another period from the initial period's expenses and putting them into inventory as assets. These expenses are then expensed or put back into expenses in the form of Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) when the items are actually sold in a subsequent period. By capitalizing expenses, the financial statements reflect a more accurate representation of the income and expenses related to the sale of products or items.

Question: What are some examples of direct expenses that are usually capitalized?
Answer: Some examples of direct expenses that are usually capitalized include labor costs, material costs, and other expenses that are directly tied to and fluctuate with the amount or number of items purchased or manufactured. These expenses are removed from the initial period's expenses and put into inventory until the items are sold. By capitalizing these expenses, they are considered assets until they are expensed as Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) in the period when the items are sold.

Question: What happens to expenses when an item is removed from expense and placed into inventory?
Answer: When an item is removed from expense and placed into inventory, the expenses associated with that item are considered "Capitalized Expenses." This means that the expenses are no longer immediately recognized as an expense in the period they were incurred. Instead, they are treated as an asset and recorded in the inventory account. These expenses remain in inventory until the item is sold.
The purpose of capitalizing expenses is to match the income generated from the sale of the item with the expenses directly related to that item. By capitalizing the expenses, the income and expenses are properly matched in the period that the income occurs. This ensures that the financial statements accurately reflect the profitability of the business.
It is important to note that not all expenses are capitalized. Generally, only direct expenses of the item sold, such as labor, materials, and other expenses that fluctuate with the quantity or number of items purchased or manufactured, are capitalized. Expenses like sales expenses, time of sale packaging, freight to the customer, and overhead items that do not directly fluctuate with the quantity or number of items are not capitalized and remain in the expense category.
Overall, the process of capitalizing expenses helps in accurately reflecting the financial performance of a business by matching income with the appropriate expenses in the period they occur.

Question: Why is it important to match income against the proper expense in the period that the income occurs?
Answer: It is important to match income against the proper expense in the period that the income occurs in order to accurately reflect the financial performance of a business. By doing so, the financial statements provide a more accurate representation of the profitability and financial health of the company during a specific period.
Matching income with the corresponding expenses ensures that the revenue generated from the sale of a product or service is properly offset by the expenses incurred to produce or deliver that product or service. This principle is known as the matching principle or the accrual accounting principle.
By capitalizing expenses, such as labor, materials, and other direct expenses, and then expensing them as Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) when the product is sold, the financial statements reflect the true cost of producing the goods sold during a specific period. This allows for a more accurate calculation of the gross profit margin and helps in evaluating the profitability of the business.
Additionally, matching income with expenses in the same period provides a clearer picture of the financial results for that period. It allows for better decision-making by management, as they can assess the profitability of specific products or services and make informed decisions regarding pricing, production, and resource allocation.
Overall, matching income against the proper expense in the period that the income occurs is crucial for financial reporting accuracy, transparency, and effective management decision-making.
