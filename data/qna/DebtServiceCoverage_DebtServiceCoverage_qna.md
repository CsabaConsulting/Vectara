Question: How is the Debt Service Coverage (DSC) Ratio calculated in ThruThink?
Answer: In ThruThink, the Debt Service Coverage (DSC) Ratio is calculated by dividing the Earnings before Interest, Income Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA) from the business by the Total Interest Expense plus Principal payments on Long Term Debt. This calculation is used to determine how normal earnings from the business can cover the debt payments. The DSC Ratio is expressed as a ratio and a common target for this calculation is 1.25:1. 
Additionally, ThruThink also calculates the Debt Service Coverage as Cash Available for Debt Service on a Trailing Twelve Month (TTM) basis. This calculation takes into account the TTM EBITDA less the TTM Non Financed Capital Expenditures plus the TTM Capital Contributions and less the TTM Capital Draws. This result is then divided by the Total TTM Interest Expense plus TTM Principal Payments on Long Term Debt. This calculation is often used by lenders as a loan covenant and the goal for this ratio is also 1.25:1.
To view the Trailing Twelve Month Debt Service (TTM DSC) calculation for Year 1 alone, the user can enter a blank as the current month on the Projection to Actual Comparison Page in the Information Browser. The TTM DSC calculation can also be seen on the right portion of the Projection Guidance to Actual to Date page under Month 12.

Question: What is the purpose of the TTM DSC calculation?
Answer: The purpose of the Trailing Twelve Month (TTM) Debt Service Coverage (DSC) calculation is to assess the ability of a business to generate enough earnings to cover its debt payments over a twelve-month period. It is a ratio that indicates the extent to which the normal earnings from the business can meet the financial obligations related to debt.
The TTM DSC calculation takes into account various financial factors such as Earnings before Interest, Income Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA), Total Interest Expense, Principal payments on Long Term Debt, Non Financed Capital Expenditures, Capital Contributions, and Capital Draws. By considering these elements, the TTM DSC provides a comprehensive view of the business's financial health and its capacity to service its debt.
Lenders often use the TTM DSC ratio as a loan covenant, meaning that it serves as a benchmark or requirement that the business must meet to maintain the terms of the loan. A common target for this ratio is 1.25:1, indicating that the business's earnings should be 1.25 times greater than its debt payments.
The TTM DSC calculation can be found in the *ThruThink* software through the Information Browser - Projection Guidance to Actual to Date page. By analyzing the TTM DSC, users can gain insights into the business's ability to manage its debt obligations and make informed decisions regarding its financial stability.
