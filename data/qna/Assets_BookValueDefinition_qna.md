Question: How is the Book Value of an individual asset or asset category determined?
Answer: The Book Value of an individual asset or asset category is determined by subtracting the accumulated depreciation or amortization expense from the original cost of the asset or assets in that category. The original cost refers to the initial purchase price or acquisition cost of the asset. Depreciation or amortization expense represents the reduction in value of the asset over time due to wear and tear, obsolescence, or the expiration of its useful life. By subtracting the accumulated depreciation or amortization expense from the original cost, the Book Value reflects the net value of the asset or asset category on the company's balance sheet.
