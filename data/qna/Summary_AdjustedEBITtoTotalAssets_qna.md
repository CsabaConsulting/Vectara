Question: What is Adjusted EBIT to Total Assets?
Answer: Adjusted EBIT to Total Assets is a percentage ratio that measures the profitability and efficiency of a company. It is calculated by taking the Adjusted EBIT (which includes the company's EBIT plus any uncompensated owner contributions) and dividing it by the total assets of the company. The total assets used in this calculation are the initial value of assets, which is after or net of depreciation.
To calculate the initial value of Adjusted EBIT, the initial EBIT is derived from the initial EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization) as entered by the user. The initial EBIT is obtained by subtracting the Year 1 Depreciation and Amortization from the initial EBITDA. This adjustment is made to ensure that the initial EBITDA input is on the same basis as the EBIT for comparison purposes.
In summary, Adjusted EBIT to Total Assets provides insight into how effectively a company is utilizing its assets to generate profits. It takes into account both the company's earnings and the value of its assets to assess its overall financial performance.

Question: How is Adjusted EBIT calculated?
Answer: Adjusted EBIT is calculated by taking the Company EBIT (Earnings Before Interest and Taxes) and adding the uncompensated Owner contribution. This sum is then divided by the Total Assets of the Company. The Total Assets used in this calculation are the Initial Value of Total Assets, which is after or net of depreciation. 
To calculate the Initial Value measure, the Initial EBIT is derived from the initial EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization) as entered by the User. The Year 1 Depreciation and Amortization are subtracted from the initial EBITDA to put the Initial EBITDA input on the same basis as the Horizon Years EBIT (Earnings Before Interest and Taxes) for comparison purposes only. 
In summary, Adjusted EBIT is a percentage ratio that considers the Company's EBIT, uncompensated Owner contribution, and Total Assets. The calculation involves adjusting the EBITDA and subtracting depreciation and amortization to ensure comparability with the Horizon Years EBIT.

Question: What is the formula for calculating Adjusted EBIT to Total Assets?
Answer: The formula for calculating Adjusted EBIT to Total Assets is as follows:
Adjusted EBIT to Total Assets = (Adjusted EBIT / Total Assets) * 100
