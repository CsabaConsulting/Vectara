Question: What type of capital gains are considered in the ThruThink analysis?
Answer: In the ThruThink analysis, all capital gains considered are Long Term Capital Gains. These capital gains represent the sale of assets that have been held for longer than one year.

Question: What is the purpose of the Capital Gains rate?
Answer: The purpose of the Capital Gains rate is to calculate the tax on the gain from the sale of assets held for longer than one year. This rate is used to determine the tax liability for the company and for individual equity owners. It is also applied to other items such as the receipt of Performance Note principal payments and the individual equity owners' after-tax equity returns from an exit sale of the company. The net income from these items is assumed to be capital gain. The Capital Gains rate helps determine the tax treatment of these gains and ensures that they are taxed appropriately.

Question: How are sales of assets recorded in the system?
Answer: Sales of assets are recorded in the system by entering a negative number on the Step 7 Capital Expenditures (CapEx) page. This negative number should reflect the net Book Value (after deduction for depreciation) for the asset sold. When the sale proceeds are entered, the Asset Class value will decrease accordingly. The system will automatically adjust the Accumulated Depreciation by formula calculation. 
If the Asset Class is reduced to zero, any excess proceeds up to the amount of the accumulated depreciation for that Asset Class will be considered as depreciation recapture and taxed as Ordinary Income. Any excess proceeds that exceed the Accumulated Depreciation for the Asset Class prior to the sale will be considered as Long Term Capital Gain.
It is also possible to make an Adjusting Journal Entry (AJE) to record a Capital Gain for an asset sale prior to the asset class being reduced to zero. This can be done in any year of the Horizon Period.
Overall, the system incorporates the net book value of asset sales to the Asset Class, and any gains or losses on the sale of assets are booked with an Adjusting Journal Entry (AJE) to Gain (Loss) on Sale of Assets in any year of the Horizon Period.
It is important to note that a Long Term Capital Loss will not be applied to Ordinary Income but will carry forward to succeeding years and can be applied to future Capital Gains.

Question: How are proceeds from an asset sale reflected in the Asset Class value?
Answer: Proceeds from an asset sale are reflected in the Asset Class value by decreasing the value of the Asset Class. When an asset is sold, a negative number is entered on the Step 7 Capital Expenditures (CapEx) page, which represents the net book value (after deduction for depreciation) of the asset sold. This negative number reduces the value of the Asset Class, such as Machinery & Equipment. 
The accumulated depreciation for the Asset Class will be automatically adjusted by formula calculation. If the Asset Class is reduced to zero, any excess proceeds up to the amount of accumulated depreciation for that Asset Class will be considered as depreciation recapture and taxed as Ordinary Income. 
However, if the excess proceeds from the sale exceed the accumulated depreciation for the Asset Class prior to the sale, it will be considered as Long Term Capital Gain. This means that any proceeds beyond the accumulated depreciation will be treated as a capital gain for tax purposes. 
It is important to note that an Adjusting Journal Entry (AJE) can be made to record a Capital Gain for an asset sale prior to the Asset Class being reduced to zero. This allows for flexibility in recording capital gains in any year of the Horizon Period. 
Overall, the proceeds from an asset sale directly impact the Asset Class value by reducing it, and the treatment of the excess proceeds depends on whether they fall within the accumulated depreciation or exceed it, determining whether they are taxed as Ordinary Income or Long Term Capital Gain.

Question: What happens when the Asset Class is reduced to zero?
Answer: When the Asset Class is reduced to zero, any excess proceeds from the sale of assets that exceed the accumulated depreciation for that Asset Class will be considered as Long Term Capital Gain. This means that the amount of money received from the sale of assets that is greater than the total depreciation taken for those assets will be treated as a capital gain for tax purposes. This capital gain will be subject to the applicable capital gains tax rate. It is important to note that any excess proceeds up to the amount of the accumulated depreciation for that Asset Class will be considered as depreciation recapture and will be taxed as Ordinary Income. Therefore, once the Asset Class is reduced to zero, any additional proceeds from the sale of assets will be treated as Long Term Capital Gain.

Question: Can an Adjusting Journal Entry be made to record a Capital Gain for an asset sale?
Answer: Yes, an Adjusting Journal Entry (AJE) can be made to record a Capital Gain for an asset sale prior to the asset class being reduced to zero. This means that if an asset is sold and the proceeds exceed the accumulated depreciation for that asset class, the excess proceeds will be considered as Long Term Capital Gain. To account for this gain, an AJE can be made to record it as Capital Gain Income in any year of the Horizon Period. This allows for the proper recording and recognition of the Capital Gain in the financial statements.

Question: How are Gains or Losses on the sale of assets booked in the system?
Answer: Gains or Losses on the sale of assets are booked in the system through an Adjusting Journal Entry (AJE) to the Gain (Loss) on Sale of Assets account. This is done in any year of the Horizon Period. The sale of assets is recorded by entering a negative number on the Step 7 Capital Expenditures (CapEx) page, which reflects the net Book Value (after deduction for depreciation) for the asset sold. All proceeds from an asset sale will decrease the value of the corresponding Asset Class. Accumulated Depreciation will be adjusted automatically by formula calculation. 
When the Asset Class is reduced to zero, any excess proceeds up to the amount of the accumulated depreciation for that Asset Class will be considered as depreciation recapture and taxed as Ordinary Income. After the Asset Class is reduced to zero, any excess proceeds that exceed the Accumulated Depreciation for the Asset Class prior to the sale will be considered as Long Term Capital Gain.
It is important to note that if a Long Term Capital Loss occurs, it will not be applied to Ordinary Income. Instead, it will carry forward to succeeding years and be applied to future Capital Gains.

Question: What happens to a Long Term Capital Loss in the system?
Answer: In the given system, a Long Term Capital Loss is not applied to Ordinary Income. Instead, it will be carried forward to succeeding years and applied to future Capital Gains. This means that if an individual or company incurs a Long Term Capital Loss in one year, they can use that loss to offset any future Long Term Capital Gains they may have. This allows them to reduce their tax liability on future gains by deducting the loss from their overall capital gains. The system does not specify any limitations on the duration for which the Long Term Capital Loss can be carried forward, so it can be assumed that it can be carried forward indefinitely until fully utilized.
