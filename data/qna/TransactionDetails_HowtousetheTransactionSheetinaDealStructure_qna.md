Question: What happens to the assets, debt, and equity used to purchase the Target Company after the acquisition?
Answer: After the acquisition of the Target Company, all the assets of the Target Company, as well as the debt and equity used to purchase it, will be rolled into the post-closing Balance Sheet. This means that the assets, debt, and equity will become part of the capital structure of the acquiring company. The Transaction Sheet, which includes the information about the Target Company's sales, EBITDA, purchase price, and assets, will be used to input this data. The equity structure for the ownership of the Target Company will also be entered in Step 8 of the Transaction Sheet. 
It is important to note that the Transaction Sheet and the Existing Company Sheet are combined into the post-closing Balance Sheet. Therefore, if the Existing Company is purchasing the Target Company, both the sales and EBITDA information entered for both companies will become the base information going forward as of the close of escrow or the Effective Date. Care should be taken to avoid duplicating any sales or EBITDA information between the Target Company and the Existing Company.
Additionally, if there are assets at the Existing Company that can be used for additional debt to acquire the Target Company, the additional debt should be entered using the Transaction Sheet option. The proceeds from this additional debt will become part of the capital structure assembled to acquire the Target Company. The Transaction Sheet Debt will be combined with the Existing Company Debt after the Effective Date (Acquisition Date). The details of the additional debt raised by the Existing Company, as well as the assets of the Target Company and equity debt/contributions from the Equity Groups, can be seen on the Information Tab Transaction Views through the Transaction Deal Structure and Transaction Buyers and Sellers Statement.

Question: What happens to the debt and equity from both the Transaction Sheet and the Existing Company after the acquisition of the Existing Company?
Answer: After the acquisition of the Existing Company, all the debt and equity from both the Transaction Sheet and the Existing Company will be rolled into the post-closing Balance Sheet. This means that the debt and equity used to acquire the Existing Company, as well as any existing debt and equity of the Existing Company, will be combined and reflected in the financial statements after the Effective Date (Acquisition Date). The Transaction Sheet Debt will be combined with the Existing Company Debt, and the equity contributions from both the Transaction Sheet and the Existing Company will become part of the capital structure assembled to acquire the Existing Company. The specific details of the debt and equity, including any additional debt raised on the assets of the Existing Company, can be viewed on the Information Tab Transaction Views through the Transaction Deal Structure and Transaction Buyers and Sellers Statement.

Question: What options are used on the Transaction Sheet when the Existing Company is purchasing the Target Company?
Answer: When the Existing Company is purchasing the Target Company, the following options are used on the Transaction Sheet:
1. Target Company Information: The Transaction Sheet option is used to enter the relevant information about the Target Company, including its sales, EBITDA, purchase price, and assets.
2. Existing Company Information: The Existing Company option is used in Steps 3, 5, and 6 to enter the information about the Existing Company, such as its sales, EBITDA, assets, and liabilities.
3. Equity Partner Groups: The Existing Company must be listed as one of the Equity Partner Groups through the Equity inputs in Step 8. This is where the ownership structure for the purchase is entered.
4. Cash Contribution: Any cash required from the Existing Company as an Equity Group will be taken from the cash listed on the Existing Company Input page. If there is not enough cash in the Existing Company's balance sheet, the Existing Company Equity Group cash contribution above the cash shown on the Existing Company Balance Sheet will not be allowed as a cash input on the Transaction Sheet Equity input.
5. Additional Debt: If there are assets at the Existing Company that can be used for additional debt to acquire the Target Company, the additional debt should be entered using the Transaction Sheet option. The proceeds from this additional debt will become part of the capital structure assembled to acquire the Target Company.

Care should be taken to avoid duplicating sales or EBITDA information between the Target Company and the Existing Company.

Question: What should be considered when determining the purchase price of a Company based on its asset value?
Answer: When determining the purchase price of a company based on its asset value, there are several factors that should be considered:
1. Current profitability: If the company has limited current profitability and its future profitability is primarily dependent on what the buyer will contribute, then the purchase price should closely reflect the net liquidation value of the company's hard assets.
2. Asset value: If the value of the assets exceeds the purchase price, then the purchase price should be adjusted to reflect the net liquidation value of the assets. In some cases, it may be appropriate to split the company purchase into two parts: (1) the buyer's purchase of the business value and (2) the liquidation of excess assets by either the seller or the buyer, depending on the situation.
3. Factors affecting asset value: When considering the net liquidation value of the assets, it is important to take into account various factors that can affect the value of the assets. These factors may include discounts for specialized use, excessive time to liquidate, condition of the asset, cost of removal, cost of reinstallation, and the value of new replacement.
4. Used asset value: It is common for used asset values to be significantly lower than the original cost of the asset. Liquidation values for some assets can be as low as 10-20% of the original cost. However, there may be cases where the cost of new replacement has significantly increased from the original cost, and in such cases, the asset may retain its original cost value.
Overall, when determining the purchase price based on asset value, it is important to carefully evaluate the current profitability, the value of the assets, and the specific factors that can impact the asset value. This will help ensure that the purchase price accurately reflects the net liquidation value of the company's assets.
