Question: What does "automatically paid" mean in relation to debt payments?
Answer: "Automatically paid" in relation to debt payments means that the payments are made automatically according to the terms input for the debt. If the option "Yes" is selected, the payments will be automatically deducted from the designated account or source of funds. This eliminates the need for manual entry of payment information. However, if the option "No" is selected, the interest on the debt will still accrue, but the cash payments must be manually entered in the Cash Flow Control Input Sheet. This gives the user the flexibility to make payments on the debt based on projected available cash in any desired year and amount. When making manual payments, the accumulated interest will be paid first, followed by the principal amount.
