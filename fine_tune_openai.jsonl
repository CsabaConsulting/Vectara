In other words, it determines the rate of return that makes the present value of the investment's cash inflows equal to the present value of its cash outflows.\n\nTo calculate the IRR, the cash flows associated with the investment are discounted back to their present value using different discount rates. The discount rate is adjusted until the sum of the present values of the cash inflows equals the sum of the present values of the cash outflows, resulting in an NPV of zero.\n\nThe IRR calculation involves iterating through different discount rates until the NPV is zero. This is typically done using numerical methods such as the Newton-Raphson method or trial and error. Once the discount rate is found, it represents the internal rate of return for the investment.\n\nIt is important to note that the IRR is a relative measure and is used as a comparison tool between different investment options rather than as a standalone rate of return. Additionally, the IRR calculation may default to zero in certain cases, such as when the total return is negative or the initial investment is zero or negative."}]}

However, there are some key differences between the two:\n\n1. Reinvestment Rate: In the IRR calculation, earnings are assumed to be reinvested at the same rate as the IRR rate. On the other hand, in the MIRR calculation, earnings are reinvested at a different rate called the Reinvestment Rate. This means that the MIRR takes into account the fact that earnings may not be reinvested at the same rate as the initial investment.\n\n2. Finance Rate: Negative cash flows from the investment are charged a Finance Rate in the MIRR calculation, which can be different from the IRR rate. This allows for the consideration of different financing costs associated with the investment.\n\n3. Partner Equity Returns: In the context of the *ThruThink* analysis, Partner Equity Returns are measured using the MIRR rate. Cash paid out to partners is not reinvested at the IRR rate, but at the Reinvestment Rate. This is because partners may choose to use the cash received for other investments or purposes.\n\n4. Default Reinvestment Rate: The default Reinvestment Rate in the MIRR calculation is set to \"0\". This means that it assumes no reinvestment of earnings. This is done because the actual reinvestment interest returns may not actually take place, and it allows for a more conservative approach in the analysis.\n\nOverall, the MIRR provides a more flexible and realistic measure of return by considering different reinvestment rates and financing costs, while the IRR assumes reinvestment at the same rate and does not account for different financing costs."}]}

The MIRR rate takes into account that cash paid out to Partners is not reinvested at the same rate as the Internal Rate of Return (IRR) rate, but at a different rate called the Re-investment Rate. \n\nIn the analysis, Partner Returns from Equity Note repayments, as well as any Partner returns from the Seller Note and Earn Out Note payments if the Partner is the Seller, are considered as Partner Equity Returns. Additionally, Equity Draws made by the Partners are also included as Partner Equity Returns. \n\nThe final liquidation of the Company is used as the last cash return to the Partners. The final sale or liquidation value of the Company reflects the cumulative profit/loss of the company, as well as any Gain or Loss on the Sale or liquidation.\n\nIt is important to note that with the MIRR, the actual dollar amount return over the life of the investment can be less than the initial investment, but the MIRR rate can still be positive. This occurs when the calculated re-investment return provides enough income to bring the sum of the returns plus the calculated re-investment interest income to be greater than the initial investment. However, it is important to consider that the actual re-investment interest returns may not actually take place.

This difference between the two depreciation amounts will result in certain consequences.\n\nFirstly, on the Income Statement, the tax expense calculated on an accrual basis will be higher than the tax expense calculated on a cash basis. This is because the accrual basis tax expense uses the book depreciation, while the cash basis tax expense uses the tax depreciation. The difference between these two tax expenses will be reflected as a Deferred Tax Liability.\n\nSecondly, on the Balance Sheet, the Deferred Tax Liability will increase. This is because the tax paid on taxable net income is less than the accrual net income due to the higher tax depreciation. The deferred tax expense generated from this difference will contribute to the increase in the Deferred Tax Liability.\n\nHowever, as the Book Depreciation eventually becomes greater than the Tax Depreciation, the Tax Depreciation expense will \"run out\" before the Book Depreciation. This will cause the taxable net income to be greater than the accrual net income and generate more tax expense than what is shown on the Accrual Income Statement. As a result, the Deferred Tax Liability on the Balance Sheet will be reduced.\n\nIt is important to note that while a user may not enter a depreciation life for book depreciation that is less than for tax, adjustments can be made to the Deferred Tax Liability account in the Balance Sheet through Adjusting Journal Entries (AJEs).

This is because the Tax Depreciation expense \"runs out\" before the Book Depreciation, causing the Taxable net income to be greater than the Accrual Net Income. As a result, more tax expense is generated than what is shown on the Accrual Income Statement. This excess tax expense reduces the Deferred Tax Liability on the Balance Sheet."}]}

In the *ThruThink* analysis, if an asset is sold at a loss, the negative number entered as an asset sale will reduce the gross value of the asset class and increase cash. However, to fully represent the asset sale, multiple adjusting journal entries (AJE) need to be made in Step 7. These AJEs will record the loss on the sale of assets, reduce the accumulated depreciation, and adjust the asset value to reflect the removal of the book value of the asset.\n\nCapital losses from the sale of assets will be carried into future years to apply against future capital gains. It is important to note that no capital loss will be applied against ordinary income. This means that the losses can only be used to offset capital gains in future years.\n\nIf adjusting journal entries are not made to record the loss and adjustment to accumulated depreciation, all asset sales will be considered as net book value, and no loss will be recognized until the asset sale proceeds exceed the entire asset class value.\n\nIn cases where the proceeds from the asset sale exceed the gross value of the asset class (prior to depreciation), the asset class value will be reduced to zero, and the excess sold value will be counted as long-term capital gain. The accumulated depreciation will be recaptured and counted as ordinary income. Adjusting journal entries in Step 7 may be made to adjust the long-term capital gain to ordinary income.\n\nAfter the asset sale, the regular depreciation expense will be reduced by an allocated amount representing the sold asset. The sale amount will be divided by the asset class life years, which will reduce the annual depreciation expense amount for the asset class. However, since these calculations are based on averages and not specific asset removal, the exact year of original acquisition of the sold asset is unknown. Therefore, the specific associated depreciation for the sold asset should be considered approximate in nature."}]}

The collection of Accounts Receivables includes the conversion of inventory into cash, as inventory is sold and customers pay for their purchases. Additionally, when new Accounts Receivables are generated through new sales, it increases the amount of cash received. The terms and conditions set by the user in the Accounts Receivable - Future Terms Set-Up and the Debt Input pages determine the increase or decrease in cash based on the collection of Accounts Receivables."}]}

The EBITDA Multiple method involves expressing the economic value of the company's operations as a multiple of its EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization). This multiple can range from 2-3 to over 10, depending on factors such as the stability of the present EBITDA and the level of risk. A higher multiple may be justified if there is a good case for substantial EBITDA growth, while a lower multiple may be appropriate if EBITDA growth is declining or the risk of EBITDA volatility is high.\n\nThe Direct Value method, on the other hand, allows the user to directly input a specific value for the company or the assets being purchased. This is useful for companies with a significant amount of hard assets, such as real estate, note receivables, intellectual property, or patents, whose value is not fully represented by the operating earnings of the company. The Direct Value can be used in conjunction with the EBITDA Multiple method or separately as a total value for the company.\n\nIt is important to note that the Cash balance of the company and its Debt are typically not included in a Market Valuation. However, for a net benefit from a Market Value Exit Sale, Cash is added to the Market Value, and Debt is subtracted, along with any excluded assets as described above."}]}

When using a Direct Value, the user simply enters a specific number that represents the value of the company or the assets being purchased. This approach is particularly useful for companies that have a significant amount of hard assets, such as real estate, note receivables, intellectual property, patents, or any other assets whose value is not fully reflected in the company's operating earnings.\n\nBy incorporating a Direct Value, the user can account for the value of these specific assets that may not be adequately captured by the EBITDA Multiple method alone. This allows for a more comprehensive assessment of the company's overall worth. Additionally, the Direct Value can be used alongside the EBITDA Multiple method to provide a total value for the company, taking into consideration both the operating earnings and the specific asset values.\n\nIt is important to note that when using the Direct Value approach, the user should ensure to enter an appropriate Exit Value for Year 10 as well as the end of the Horizon time period, especially for Horizon time periods exceeding 10 years. This is because the *ThruThink Deal Evaluation* tool evaluates only the first 10 years of a deal and will utilize the Hard Asset liquidation value for the Exit Value at year 10 if a Market Value is not available. \n\nLastly, it is worth mentioning that the Cash balance of the company and its Debt are typically not included in a Market Valuation. However, for a net benefit calculation from a Market Value Exit Sale, Cash is added to the Market Value, and the Debt, along with any excluded assets as described in the documentation, is subtracted."}]}

It is calculated by multiplying the company's Earnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (EBITDA) by a predetermined multiple. The multiple is typically derived from comparable companies or industry standards.\n\nTo determine the company value using the EBITDA Multiple option, the EBITDA is first calculated by adding back interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization to the company's net income. This provides a measure of the company's operating performance without the impact of non-operating expenses.\n\nOnce the EBITDA is determined, it is then multiplied by the chosen multiple. For example, if the EBITDA is $1 million and the multiple is 5x, the company value would be $5 million.\n\nThe EBITDA Multiple option is commonly used in valuing companies, especially in industries where earnings are a key driver of value. It provides a simple and standardized approach to determine company value based on its earnings performance. However, it is important to note that the EBITDA Multiple option does not take into account other factors such as market conditions, growth prospects, or specific company characteristics, which may also influence the company's value."}]}

It is calculated by subtracting the Cash balance from the value of all the Assets. Additionally, if there are cumulative net losses, the amount of those losses will be added back to represent a reimbursement of those losses. The Cash balance and Debt of the Company are not typically included in a Market Valuation. To achieve a net benefit from a Market Value Exit Sale, Cash is added to the Market Value, and the Debt is subtracted, along with any excluded asset categories on the Balance Sheet such as A/R, Inventory, Notes Receivable, Equipment, or Real Estate."}]}

By considering these elements, the TTM DSC provides a comprehensive view of the business's financial health and its capacity to service its debt.\n\nLenders often use the TTM DSC ratio as a loan covenant, meaning that it serves as a benchmark or requirement that the business must meet to maintain the terms of the loan. A common target for this ratio is 1.25:1, indicating that the business's earnings should be 1.25 times greater than its debt payments.\n\nThe TTM DSC calculation can be found in the *ThruThink* software through the Information Browser - Projection Guidance to Actual to Date page.

This should only be done when the Renewal is set to 'No' for the year in question.\n\nHere are the steps to change the payment month:\n\n1. By default, the payoff for each Individually Scheduled Other Current Loan will be paid off (unless renewed) in the next year, 12 months after the Funding Month.\n2. If the payoff needs to be earlier in the Payoff Year, enter a negative loan amount for the payoff in the desired month and enter the Payoff Year as the Funding Year. In the Description Field, enter 'Move' for that amount.\n3. Enter another corresponding positive amount in the 12 month anniversary month in the Payoff Year for the original loan amount. Again, enter 'Move' in the Description Field for that entry.\n4. This effectively moves the payoff from the original 12 month anniversary month to the new required month in the Payoff Year.\n5. It is important to note that this option should only be used when the Renewal is set to 'No' for the year with the negative amounts.\n6. Similarly, if the payoff needs to be later in the same year as the Funding Year and not in the Succeeding Year, enter a negative loan amount for the payoff in the desired month (must be after the Funding Month of the original loan) for the Funding Year. Enter 'Move' in the Description Field for that amount.\n7. Enter a positive amount in the 12 month anniversary month of the original loan in the Succeeding Year. Again, enter 'Move' in the Description Field for that entry.\n8. This effectively moves the payoff from the original 12 month anniversary month to the new required month in the same year as the Funding Year.\n9. Remember to enter 'Move' in the Description Field for both the positive and negative adjustment amounts when entering negative amounts to move the payment month.\n\nPlease note that the Individually Scheduled portion of the Other Current Debt can be renewed annually by selecting 'Yes' on the Other Current Debt page. This will extend the loan anniversaries by 12 months."}]}

Specifically, the write-off amount will reduce the value of Accounts Receivables and Inventories on the balance sheet. Additionally, it will increase the expense on the income statement.\n\nBy removing the uncollectable Accounts Receivables and unusable Inventories, the company acknowledges that it is unlikely to recover the full amount owed or utilize the inventory effectively. As a result, the value of these assets is adjusted downwards to reflect their true worth.\n\nOn the balance sheet, the reduction in Accounts Receivables will decrease the total assets of the company. Similarly, the decrease in Inventory will also lower the value of assets. This adjustment is necessary to provide a more accurate representation of the company's financial position.\n\nOn the income statement, the write-off amount is recorded as an expense. This expense is recognized to reflect the loss incurred due to the uncollectable Accounts Receivables and unusable Inventories. By recognizing this expense, the company accurately reflects the impact of these write-offs on its profitability for the year.\n\nIn summary, the write-off of uncollectable Accounts Receivables and unusable Inventories at the end of the year reduces the value of assets on the balance sheet and increases the expense on the income statement. This adjustment ensures that the financial statements provide a more accurate representation of the company's financial position and performance."}]}

This means that in the event of default or bankruptcy, the holders of senior debt have a higher claim on the assets compared to other creditors. The assets that secure the individual loan are known as loan collateral. The senior debt is typically a percentage of the value of the collateral, known as the loan-to-value ratio, which allows for a recovery margin in case the lender needs to recover the collateral to repay the loan.

Misrepresentation of Company Value: If the owner's significant contributions of time and talent are not properly accounted for, the Company's performance could be perceived as creating a \"job\" or lifestyle for the owner rather than demonstrating independent company value to an independent party. This could lead to a misrepresentation of the true worth of the Company.\n\n2. Inaccurate EBITDA Projections: The owner's contribution of time and talent is critical to the day-to-day operations of the Company. If these contributions are not adequately included in the expense or EBITDA inputs, the projected EBITDA going forward may not accurately reflect the true value of the owner's involvement. This could result in inaccurate financial projections and potentially mislead investors or potential buyers.\n\n3. Underestimation of Owner Compensation: In smaller companies, the owner's compensation can have a significant impact on the performance of the Company. If the owner's compensation is not realistically estimated and included as an expense, it may lead to an underestimation of the financial resources required to support the owner's contributions. This could affect the overall financial health and sustainability of the Company.\n\n4. Limited Understanding of Operational Contributions: By not reflecting the owner's contributions, there may be a limited understanding of the true operational contributions made by the owner. This could lead to a lack of recognition for the owner's efforts and potentially undervalue their role in the success of the Company.\n\nIn summary, not reflecting the owner's contribution in the Company's performance evaluation can result in a misrepresentation of Company value, inaccurate financial projections, underestimation of owner compensation, and a limited understanding of operational contributions. It is important to properly account for the owner's contributions to ensure a comprehensive and accurate evaluation of the Company's performance."}]}

In smaller companies, the Owner's compensation can have a significant impact on the performance of the company. Therefore, a realistic estimate of the compensation necessary or required for the Owner should be made.\n\nFurthermore, the Owner's living expenses and cash withdrawals should be considered in relation to their actual operational contributions. Any amounts required over and above the Owner's operational contributions can be made through non-expense cash withdrawals, which can be reflected in the Non-Expense Cash Flow page.\n\nIf the Owner chooses not to withdraw cash from the company, an expense for the Owner's contribution can be made, and then a cash contribution in the Non-Expense Cash Flow page for the same amount can be made. This way, the expense is reflected in the EBITDA calculations, but the cash is contributed back for cash flow purposes.\n\nOverall, it is crucial to ensure that the Owner's requirement for living expenses or cash withdrawals is aligned with their actual operational contributions and expectations for compensation."}]}

This fee is paid at the end of a predetermined period, known as the Payment Beginning Year. PIK is considered as additional interest that is accrued but remains unpaid until the Payment Beginning Year.\n\nPIK is in addition to the regular stated interest rate for the loan. It is calculated as a percentage, known as the PIK Interest Rate, applied to the loan's beginning balance for each year it is in effect. This applies from the initial period of the loan until the Payment Beginning Year.\n\nThe PIK payment can be made in two ways: either as a lump sum or in annual installments. If paid in installments, these payments begin in the Payment Beginning Year and continue annually for the specified number of years indicated for the number of Payments.\n\nFrom an accounting perspective, the PIK Interest is treated as an accrued interest expense while it is accruing. This creates an accrued liability on the books. When the PIK payment is made, it results in a reduction of cash and a reduction of the liability. For cash basis taxes, the PIK payment is considered a cash basis expense in the year it is paid.

It is calculated by dividing the loan amount by the appraised value of the collateral. \n\nIn the context of loan collateral, the LTV Ratio determines the maximum amount of loan that can be granted based on the value of the collateral. For example, if the LTV Ratio is 80%, it means that the lender is willing to provide a loan up to 80% of the appraised value of the collateral. \n\nThe purpose of using the LTV Ratio is to ensure that there is a sufficient margin of recovery for the lender in case they need to sell the collateral to repay the loan. By setting a maximum LTV Ratio, lenders can mitigate the risk of potential losses if the borrower defaults on the loan. \n\nIt is important to note that different lenders may have different LTV Ratio requirements based on their risk appetite and the type of collateral being used. Higher LTV Ratios indicate higher risk for the lender, as there is less equity in the collateral to cover the loan amount.

In this arrangement, the amount that can be borrowed is determined based on the Borrowing Base, which includes the value of collateral securing the Line of Credit, such as Accounts Receivables and Inventory, minus any reserves.\n\nThe lender will advance a percentage of the Loan to Value against the Borrowing Base. For example, if the Borrowing Base is $100,000 and the Loan to Value percentage is 80%, the lender will provide a loan of $80,000.\n\nFor Accounts Receivables, the lender may have control over the receipt of the payments. This can be done through a Lock Box arrangement, where the company's customers pay directly to the lender. As the Accounts Receivables are received, the loan balance is reduced. To access additional funds on the Line of Credit, the Accounts Receivables are recalculated, and any new loan funds in excess of the existing loan balance become available to the company.\n\nSimilarly, for inventory, when it is sold, either cash or a receivable is created. If cash is received, the inventory loan should be reduced. At a specific point in time, the Inventory value is calculated and added to the Borrowing Base, along with the updated Accounts Receivables. A new allowable loan balance is then determined for both Inventory and Accounts Receivables and compared with the existing loan balance. If the allowable loan balance exceeds the existing loan balance, the excess amount can be drawn by the company. However, if the existing loan balance exceeds the allowable loan balance, the company is required to pay down the loan to the allowable balance.\n\nIt is important to note that the specifics of Borrowing Base repayment can vary depending on the financial health of the company and its relationship with the lender. The purpose of this repayment structure is to simulate the flow of money from purchasing inventory to the collection of accounts receivable. The outstanding loan amount should always align with the terms agreed upon by the user at any given point in time."}]}

Relationship with the Lender: A long-standing and positive relationship between the Company and the Lender can also influence the level of control. If the Company has a history of successfully managing its Line of Credit and maintaining a good relationship with the Lender, the Lender may be more flexible and grant more control.\n\n3. Collateral value: The value of the collateral securing the Line of Credit, such as Accounts Receivables and Inventory, can also impact the level of control. If the collateral has a high value and is easily liquidated, the Lender may be more comfortable granting greater control.\n\n4. Loan terms: The specific terms and conditions of the Line of Credit can also determine the level of control. The Lender may impose certain requirements or restrictions on the Company's operations to mitigate risk and ensure repayment. These terms can vary depending on the Lender's policies and the Company's financial situation.\n\n5. Industry and market conditions: The overall industry and market conditions can also influence the level of control the Lender has. In volatile or uncertain industries, the Lender may exercise more control to protect their interests and mitigate potential risks.\n\nIt is important to note that the level of control can vary significantly from one Line of Credit to another, and it is determined through negotiations between the Company and the Lender based on various factors and considerations."}]}

It helps to analyze the liquidity and cash position of a company, as well as its ability to generate cash from its operations.\n\nIn summary, the main difference between the Cash Flow statement and the Income Statement is that the Income Statement focuses on the profitability of a business, while the Cash Flow statement provides information about the actual cash flow and liquidity of the business."}]}

It is important to provide a realistic assessment of this contribution as it is a significant factor in evaluating the deal.\n\nIt is worth noting that the value of the Un-Compensated Owner Contribution should not be considered as the return on the owner's equity, which should be reflected in Step 8 of the evaluation process. Additionally, for proper evaluation of the company's past and future performance, the Historical EBITDA and projected EBITDA should also reflect any applicable Un-Compensated Owner Contribution.

By considering these elements, the TTM DSC provides a comprehensive view of the company's ability to service its debt obligations.\n\nA common target for the TTM DSC ratio is 1.25:1, meaning that the business should generate earnings that are 1.25 times greater than its debt payments. This ratio is often used as a loan covenant by lenders to ensure that the borrower has a sufficient margin of safety to meet its financial obligations.\n\nThe TTM DSC calculation can be found in the *ThruThink* software through the Information Browser, specifically in the Projection Guidance to Actual to Date page.

Instead, it accrues interest at a selected rate, and the principal and interest can be paid off with manual excess cash payments.\n\nThe separation of the Seller Note into Current Pay and Non Current Pay is done to comply with possible conditions set by senior or sub debt lenders. These lenders may require that the seller not be paid ahead of them. If this condition applies, the Seller Debt can be designated as Non Current Pay and paid from the Cash Flow Control page when there is extra cash and the lender criteria permit.\n\nIn terms of excess payments from the Cash Flow Control, any excess cash will first be applied to outstanding interest on the Non Current Pay Seller Note, then to the principal on the Non Current Pay Seller Note.

In some cases, it may be appropriate to split the company purchase into two parts: (1) the buyer's purchase of the business value and (2) the liquidation of excess assets by either the seller or the buyer, depending on the situation.\n\n3. Factors affecting asset value: When considering the net liquidation value of the assets, it is important to take into account various factors that can affect the value of the assets. These factors may include discounts for specialized use, excessive time to liquidate, condition of the asset, cost of removal, cost of reinstallation, and the value of new replacement.\n\n4. Used asset value: It is common for used asset values to be significantly lower than the original cost of the asset. Liquidation values for some assets can be as low as 10-20% of the original cost. However, there may be cases where the cost of new replacement has significantly increased from the original cost, and in such cases, the asset may retain its original cost value.\n\nOverall, when determining the purchase price based on asset value, it is important to carefully evaluate the current profitability, the value of the assets, and the specific factors that can impact the asset value. This will help ensure that the purchase price accurately reflects the net liquidation value of the company's assets."}]}

It is backed by the value of the company, typically before any payment of seller debt, equity debt, and equity holders. Subordinated debt carries more risk than other types of debt, and as a result, the terms associated with subordinated debt are usually more complex.\n\nIn the context of the *ThruThink* analysis, subordinated debt can include provisions for payment in kind interest and warrants, which provide the lender of subordinated debt with opportunities to be compensated for the higher risk involved.\n\nAdditionally, the analysis allows for cash flow control payments to be made towards subordinated debt. These payments are in addition to any regularly scheduled payments and can be used to manage cash flow by either paying down debt or drawing new debt to supplement cash.\n\nRepayment of subordinated debt can be structured in different ways. The transaction sheet subordinated debt can be repaid either through interest-only payments with the entire principal amount due in the last year of the loan or through level annual principal and interest payments throughout the loan term. The user also has the option to enter individually scheduled subordinated debt with up to six separate debts, each with four repayment options: interest only, amortized level payment, and level principal plus interest.\n\nIt is important to note that subordinated debt often carries a higher interest rate compared to senior debt. If the company has excess cash, it may choose to pay down the higher interest rate subordinated debt before the end of the debt term. However, there is usually a prepayment penalty associated with early pay down of subordinated debt. The prepayment penalty, expressed as a percentage, applies to the principal portion of all subordinated debt in the analysis and will reduce cash and be considered an expense in the year of payment. The specific prepayment percentage is an input on the subordinated prepayment penalty input page."}]}

Subordinated debt holders have a lower priority of repayment in the event of bankruptcy or liquidation compared to senior debt holders. This means that if a company faces financial distress, senior debt holders will be paid back first before subordinated debt holders receive any repayment.\n\nThe higher interest rate compensates subordinated debt holders for the increased risk they bear. Since they are more likely to face losses in the event of default, the higher interest rate helps to offset this risk and provide a higher potential return on investment.

It carries a higher level of risk compared to other types of debt.\n\nIn the context of the *ThruThink* analysis, the prepayment penalty applies to the prepayment of the principal portion of all subordinated debt in the transaction sheet, existing company, and individually scheduled subordinated debt. The penalty is designed to compensate the debt holder for the early pay down of the debt, as the term of the subordinated debt is often integral in providing a certain desired rate of return on the investment for the debt holder.\n\nThe prepayment penalty is expressed as a percentage and is an input on the subordinated prepayment penalty input page. When a prepayment is made, the penalty amount will reduce cash and be recorded as an expense in the year of payment. This penalty serves as a deterrent for borrowers to pay off the debt early and helps ensure that the debt holder receives the expected return on their investment."}]}

This principle is known as the matching principle or the accrual accounting principle.\n\nBy capitalizing expenses, such as labor, materials, and other direct expenses, and then expensing them as Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) when the product is sold, the financial statements reflect the true cost of producing the goods sold during a specific period. This allows for a more accurate calculation of the gross profit margin and helps in evaluating the profitability of the business.\n\nAdditionally, matching income with expenses in the same period provides a clearer picture of the financial results for that period. It allows for better decision-making by management, as they can assess the profitability of specific products or services and make informed decisions regarding pricing, production, and resource allocation.\n\nOverall, matching income against the proper expense in the period that the income occurs is crucial for financial reporting accuracy, transparency, and effective management decision-making."}]}

This should only be done when the Renewal is set to 'No' for the year involved. Here are the steps to change the payment month:\n\n1. By default, the payoff for each Individually Scheduled Other Current Loan will be paid off (unless renewed) in the next year (Payoff Year), 12 months after the Funding Month.\n2. If the payoff needs to be earlier in the Payoff Year, enter a negative loan amount for the payoff in the month needed and enter the Payoff Year as the Funding Year. Also, enter 'Move' in the Description Field for that amount.\n3. Enter another corresponding positive amount in the 12 month anniversary month in the Payoff Year for the original loan amount. Again, enter 'Move' in the Description Field for that entry as well.\n4. This effectively moves the payoff from the original 12 month anniversary month to the new required month in the Payoff Year. Remember, this option should only be used when the Renewal is set to 'No' for the year with the negative amounts.\n5. If the payoff needs to be later in the same year as the Funding Year and not in the Succeeding Year, enter a negative loan amount for the payoff in the month needed (must be after the Funding Month of the original loan) for the Funding Year. Enter 'Move' in the Description Field for that amount.\n6. Enter a positive amount in the 12 month anniversary month of the original loan in the Succeeding Year. Again, enter 'Move' in the Description Field for that entry as well.\n7. This effectively moves the payoff from the original 12 month anniversary month to the new required month in the same year as the Funding Year. Remember, this option should only be used when the Renewal is set to 'No' for the year with the negative amounts.\n8. It is important to enter 'Move' in the Description Field for both the positive and negative adjustment amounts when entering negative amounts to move the payment month.\n\nPlease note that these adjustments should be made carefully, and it is recommended to double-check the entries to ensure the desired effect on cash flow."}]}

Depreciation is a non-cash expense that should not affect Working Capital. Therefore, when using Net Income that includes Depreciation to explain the change in Working Capital, it is crucial to also include the change in Long Term Assets during the period from the balance sheet. \n\nThe reason for this is that Depreciation reduces the value of assets, similar to if an item were sold. By showing the change in asset value along with the Net Income, the effect of Depreciation as an expense (debit) will be offset by the reduction in Assets (credit), resulting in no change in Working Capital caused by Depreciation.\n\nSimilarly, this caution applies to other non-cash items such as Gain or Loss from Sale of Assets and changes in deferred taxes. As long as the Net Income is presented together with the change in Long Term Assets and Long Term Liabilities, the impact of these non-cash items on Working Capital can be accurately assessed. \n\nTo maintain consistency in the Projection to Actual Comparison, the actual amount for the Assets should be the Gross amount without the reduction for Accumulated Depreciation/Amortization. This ensures that the analysis accurately reflects the impact of non-cash items on Working Capital."}]}

The Tax Rate Schedule provided is for general reference and convenience, and any default entries are very general in nature. It is important to note that these calculations are not intended to reflect actual tax computations based on any specific tax code.\n\nThe analysis considers two types of income tax: Federal or Country Income Tax and State or Region Income Tax. The Tax Rate Input page allows for up to seven graduated taxable income levels for each type of tax, although the default is just one tax level for all taxable net income. The User has the flexibility to adjust these rates accordingly.\n\nThe *ThruThink* analysis applies the rates shown in the Tax Rate Input page to the Taxable Net Income calculated by the analysis for future years. Taxable Net Income is a generalized assessment of taxable net income, calculated as EBITDA less Interest paid less the Tax basis depreciation and amortization expense.\n\nFor Cash Flow purposes, estimated tax payments are made on a quarterly basis during the Taxable Year in Periods 4, 6, 9, and 12. Actual taxes are then calculated for the Taxable Year and paid in Period 4 of the following year, taking into account the estimated payments made during the Taxable Year.\n\nAt the end of the Taxable Year, there will be an Income Tax Liability, which represents the difference between the Taxes Owed and the estimated tax payments made during the Taxable Year.\n\nIt is important to consult with a tax specialist and refer to the appropriate tax code for a more specific estimate of tax expense or liability in any individual situation."}]}

Confidence factor: The Risk Rating is further factored by a Confidence factor based on the historical EBITDA. If there is limited historical information, the Confidence factor will be low, which will substantially affect the Risk Rating.\n\n3. Comparison with the current yield of 10 Year United States Treasury Notes: The Risk Rating is also factored by comparing it with the current yield of 10 Year United States Treasury Notes.\n\n4. Market Value or Hard Asset Value: The Risk Rating uses the Market Value of the deal or Company after a Long Term Capital Gain tax deduction, without the Liabilities of the Company at the end of the earlier of 10 years or the Horizon Years as the cash return at the end of the investment. If a Market Value is not provided by the User, a Hard Asset Value (w/o amortized assets such as goodwill) liquidation of the assets will be used instead.\n\nThese factors are taken into account to determine the Risk Rating of a deal or investment."}]}

The Sale Amount will be divided by the Asset Class life years, resulting in a reduction in the annual depreciation expense for the Asset Class. However, since these calculations are based on averages and not specific asset removal, the exact year of acquisition for the Sold Asset is unknown.

This sum is then divided by the Total Assets of the Company. The Total Assets used in this calculation are the Initial Value of Total Assets, which is after or net of depreciation. \n\nTo calculate the Initial Value measure, the Initial EBIT is derived from the initial EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization) as entered by the User. The Year 1 Depreciation and Amortization are subtracted from the initial EBITDA to put the Initial EBITDA input on the same basis as the Horizon Years EBIT (Earnings Before Interest and Taxes) for comparison purposes only. \n\nIn summary, Adjusted EBIT is a percentage ratio that considers the Company's EBIT, uncompensated Owner contribution, and Total Assets. The calculation involves adjusting the EBITDA and subtracting depreciation and amortization to ensure comparability with the Horizon Years EBIT."}]}

This means that if a company experiences a net operating loss in a particular year, it can use that loss to reduce its taxable income in future years. The NOL can be applied against both federal and regional taxable net income in the analysis. It is important for the user to consult with their accountant or tax preparer to ensure that the NOL will be available and applicable to the entity's future taxable net income. When entering an NOL amount, a corresponding input for the asset value of the NOL should be made by entering a negative number for the beginning Deferred Tax Liability balance. This negative liability acts as an asset and is considered a tax credit against future years' net income for tax calculation purposes. The NOL is applied against the next year's positive net income, reducing the actual taxes owed for that year and succeeding positive net income years until it is completely used. For cash flow purposes, estimated tax payments are made on a quarterly basis during the taxable year, and actual taxes are calculated and paid in the following year with a credit taken for the estimated payments made during the taxable year. The NOL is also reflected in the income statement, where the deferred tax asset is reduced and expensed as a non-cash deferred tax expense. At the end of the taxable year, there may be an income tax liability for the difference between the taxes owed and the estimated tax payments made during the year. Similarly, any losses incurred during the horizon years can also be carried forward and applied to net income in subsequent years. The input for the NOL can be found on the Tax Rate Input page."}]}

The user should also ensure that the NOL will actually be available and applicable to the entity's future taxable net income as represented in the projections.\n\nIn the analysis, the NOL will apply to both Federal and Region taxable net income. It will be applied against the next year of positive net income (Taxable Year), thereby reducing the actual taxes owed for that year and succeeding positive net income years until completely used.\n\nFor tax payment purposes, estimated tax payments are made on a quarterly basis during the Taxable Year in Period 4, 6, 9, and 12. The actual taxes are then calculated for the Taxable Year and paid in Period 4 of the following year, taking into account the estimated payments made during the Taxable Year.\n\nFrom a cash flow perspective, the NOL reduces the taxes owed, resulting in lower tax payments in the Taxable Year. However, from an accrual point of view, the Income Statement for the Taxable Year will still show a tax expense for the Taxes Owed (reduced by the NOL) and a Deferred Tax expense to reflect the write-off of the Tax Credit asset in the Taxable Year.\n\nAt the end of the Taxable Year, there may be an Income Tax Liability for the difference between the Taxes Owed and the estimated tax payments made during the Taxable Year.\n\nAdditionally, any losses incurred during the Horizon Years (future years) can also be carried forward and applied to net income in subsequent years.\n\nTo input the NOL amount, the user can find the input field on the Tax Rate Input page. It is important to enter a corresponding input for the asset value of the NOL by entering a negative number for the beginning Deferred Tax Liability balance in Step 6.

A positive working capital indicates that the company has enough resources to meet its short-term obligations, while a negative working capital suggests potential liquidity issues.\n\nIn summary, working capital serves as a financial metric to assess the ability of a company or deal to fulfill its current financial obligations within the next 12 months."}]}

If there is a high confidence in the growth of EBITDA, it justifies a higher EBITDA debt multiple. This means that if the company has a positive and consistent trend of EBITDA growth, it indicates a stronger financial performance and ability to generate earnings. As a result, lenders or investors may be more willing to provide a higher level of debt relative to the company's EBITDA.\n\nOn the other hand, if there is a lower confidence in EBITDA growth or a negative EBITDA growth history, it indicates a weaker financial performance and potential risks. In such cases, a lower level of acceptable EBITDA debt multiple would be considered appropriate. Lenders or investors may be more cautious and limit the amount of debt relative to the company's EBITDA to mitigate the potential risks associated with the company's financial performance.\n\nIn summary, the trend factor in EBITDA growth influences the acceptable EBITDA debt multiple. A positive and consistent EBITDA growth trend increases the acceptable debt multiple, while a negative or uncertain EBITDA growth trend decreases the acceptable debt multiple."}]}

This process is specifically designed to illustrate a \"Restructure Plan\" of Short Term Debt, such as Accounts Receivable, Inventory, or Other Current Debt, to Long Term Debt. By restructuring these items, the company can increase its Working Capital.\n\nWorking Capital is a measure of a company's short-term liquidity and its ability to meet its current obligations. It is calculated by subtracting current liabilities from current assets. By converting short-term debt into long-term debt, the company can potentially free up cash and improve its Working Capital position.\n\nThe Restructure Process enables the user to represent the original item on the Existing Company Balance Sheet and then \"restructure\" it before the Effective Date. This is done by adding a corresponding Adjustment to the Balance Sheet using one of the Individually Scheduled Debt or Asset Item Inputs. The Adjustment addition will then appear in the \"Adjustment Column\" on the Existing Company Balance Sheet.\n\nIt is important to note that the Adjusted Balances resulting from the Restructure Process are the ones subsequently used in the analysis. This means that the impact of the restructuring on Working Capital will be reflected in the analysis and can be evaluated to assess the potential improvement in the company's liquidity position.\n\nOverall, the Restructure Process provides a mechanism for the user to strategically restructure certain items on the balance sheet, particularly short-term debt, to long-term debt, with the aim of increasing Working Capital and improving the company's financial health."}]}

By subtracting the accumulated depreciation or amortization from the original cost of the asset, the Book Value provides an estimate of the asset's current worth on the company's balance sheet. This calculation is important for financial reporting, as it helps in assessing the value of assets and determining their potential for generating future returns. Additionally, the Book Value is used in various financial analyses, such as determining the company's net worth, evaluating the performance of assets over time, and making informed decisions regarding asset management and investment strategies."}]}

The User also enters an Increment of EBITDA Growth, which represents the amount of EBITDA growth required for the Earn Out to increase.\n3. The Duration period is entered by the User, indicating the number of years the Earn Out calculations should apply.\n4. The calculation for the EBITDA Earn Out Option 1 is as follows:\n   - Calculate the EBITDA growth over the Duration period by subtracting the Base EBITDA from the EBITDA at the end of the Duration period.\n   - Divide the EBITDA growth over the Duration period by the Increment of EBITDA Growth.\n   - Multiply the result by the EBITDA Multiple Increase.\n   - Multiply the EBITDA at the time of acquisition (Base EBITDA) by the calculated multiple increase.\n   - The resulting amount becomes the Earn Out Note, which will be paid in accordance with the terms of the Seller Earn Out Note.\n\nFor example, if the initial EBITDA multiple is 5 and the EBITDA Multiple Increase is 0.25 for each $100,000 increase in EBITDA over the first 3 years (Duration) after purchase, and the Company's EBITDA increased a total of $300,000 during that period, the EBITDA multiple for which the Company purchase was based increases by 1.5, making the final multiple 6.5.

The second category includes Amortized Assets identified on the Capital Expenditures Input page, and separate life periods in years may be used for each category.\n\nBoth categories of amortized assets are capitalized to the Amortized Asset category on the Balance Sheet. Each year of the life period, an amortization expense is calculated using the same life period for both accrual expenses and cash basis expenses. \n\nIt is important to note that the default life period for both asset categories, unless changed by the user, is 15 years. However, users should consult with their tax advisors to determine the proper life period to use.\n\nAdditionally, it is worth mentioning that the existing company asset amortization expense is entered by the user in whole numbers and is not calculated automatically."}]}

This assumes that the asset was liquidated for cash. If no cash was collected or there was a difference between the asset reduction and cash collected (gain or loss), a corresponding number should be inserted as an Income or Expense entry. This will adjust cash and income or expense for the gain or loss. A positive number should be used for an Expense (loss), and a negative number should be used for Income (gain). \n\nIf a depreciable asset account is being adjusted, it is assumed that the asset was adjusted at the beginning of the year. The annual depreciation expense for that year will be adjusted based on the percentage of the asset being adjusted to total assets. This adjustment will also affect net income and income taxes accordingly.\n\nWhen an asset is purchased, the Capital Expenditures Input page should be used to input the purchase. If an asset is sold, an Adjusting Journal Entry (AJE) may be used to reduce the original cost of the asset (using a negative number). If the sale price is larger than the cost (prior to depreciation), the difference between the sale price and the cost should be entered as a negative number as Income. If the sale price is less than the cost, a positive number should be entered as an Expense. The accumulated depreciation will be adjusted proportionately based on the percentage that the item cost is to the total cost. However, please note that the calculations cannot anticipate variations in the period the asset was placed in service or removed, as asset purchases may be entered by the user in varying periods.\n\nIn summary, to adjust assets:\n1. Insert a negative number for a reduction in the asset.\n2. Insert a corresponding number as an Income or Expense entry to adjust cash and income or expense for any gain or loss.\n3. Use a positive number for an Expense (loss) and a negative number for Income (gain).\n4. Adjustments to depreciable assets will affect annual depreciation expense, net income, and income taxes.\n5. Use the Capital Expenditures Input page for asset purchases and AJEs for asset sales."}]}

This value is typically entered on the Cash Flow Control page and overrides the % of Sales COGS inputs.\n\nIndividually Identified COGS, however, provide a more detailed approach. For Years 1-3, the user can enter specific items or categories of cost of goods sold on the Individually Scheduled COGS Input page. These individually identified items are separate and in addition to any % of Sales or Whole Number COGS inputs. The balance of the Horizon Years (years beyond Year 3) will use the same input as Year 3, unless overridden with an individual input for the total of the Individually Identified Items in any of the applicable Horizon Years.\n\nIn summary, Individually Identified COGS allow for a more granular and specific input of cost of goods sold items, while % of Sales and Whole Number COGS inputs provide more general and broad approaches to calculating the cost of goods sold."}]}

Sales/EBITDA performance of the Company: It is important to evaluate the company's sales and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) performance. If the company is consistently generating low sales or experiencing declining profitability, it may indicate underlying issues with the business model or market conditions.\n\n2. Debt structure: Assessing the company's debt structure is crucial. If the company has a high level of debt or is struggling to meet its debt obligations, it can put significant strain on the cash flow. Evaluating the terms of the debt, interest rates, and repayment schedule is necessary to understand the impact on the cash balance.\n\n3. Amount of Equity: The amount of equity invested in the company should also be considered. Insufficient equity investment may result in a lack of financial resources to support the business operations and cover cash flow shortfalls. Adequate equity investment is essential for a healthy cash balance.\n\n4. Combination of factors: It is important to analyze the interplay between these factors. A combination of poor sales performance, excessive debt, and inadequate equity can exacerbate cash flow issues. Evaluating the overall deal structure and considering potential adjustments may be necessary to ensure the viability of the company.\n\nIn summary, when the Cash Balance is minimal or negative over a sustained period of time, it is crucial to assess the sales/EBITDA performance, debt structure, amount of equity, and their combined impact. This evaluation will help determine if adjustments need to be made to the deal structure or if the overall viability of the company needs to be reconsidered."}]}

It provides a more accurate representation of the financial performance of a business as it matches revenues with the expenses incurred to generate those revenues.\n\nIn contrast, the Cash Basis method only considers the actual cash inflows and outflows, without considering when the underlying transactions occurred. It is simpler and easier to understand, but it may not provide an accurate picture of the financial performance since it does not account for transactions that have been made but not yet paid or received.\n\nIn summary, the main difference between the Accrual Basis method and the Cash Basis method is the timing of when income and expenses are recognized.

The accrued warrant value represents the liability created by the warrant provisions of the subordinated debt.

However, it is crucial to avoid \"wishful thinking\" or arbitrary adjustments that may artificially improve profitability and cash flow.\n\n2. Debt Structure: The company's debt structure should be reviewed. Adjustments can be made by increasing the debt amount, extending the repayment terms, or making the debt interest-only. These adjustments can help ease the impact on cash flow in the short term.\n\n3. Loans and Capital Expenditures: Each loan shown on the Cash Flow Control should be analyzed and adjusted where appropriate. New loans can also be created if necessary. Capital expenditures should be reviewed, and the need for non-financed capital expenditure should be critiqued. Financing options can be explored to conserve cash.\n\n4. Accounts Receivable Average Days to Collect: The time it takes to collect accounts receivable has a direct impact on cash flow. Lowering the average time to collect accounts receivable will improve cash flow. The average weeks to collect accounts receivable can be adjusted by the user.\n\n5. Inventory Average Days to Hold: The length of time inventory is held before being sold (inventory turn) affects cash flow. Lowering the average time inventory is held will improve cash flow. The average weeks to hold inventory can be adjusted by the user.\n\n6. Accounts Payable Aging: The frequency of paying accounts payable can impact cash flow on a weekly, monthly, or seasonal basis. Adjusting the payment frequency for accounts payable can help manage cash flow.\n\n7. Individually Scheduled Items: Individually scheduled items such as accounts receivable, inventory creation and use, cost of goods sold, other expenses, and income can have an impact on cash flow. These items allow for input by month to adjust cash flow more specifically within the year.\n\nBy reviewing and adjusting these factors, a company can improve its cash flow position and ensure better financial stability."}]}

The cash equity contributions by each Equity Group should be made in the same percentage as the Equity Group's percent ownership inputs. This means that each Equity Group's ownership of the total Company is attributed based on the actual percent of equity contributed.\n\nIf an Equity Group contributes cash amounts that are over their ownership equity percentages, these excess contributions can be made as an Equity Note, which will become a loan to the Company. The Equity Note can have a zero interest rate or any other interest rate desired. This allows the Equity split of the total Company to remain consistent with the Equity Percent Ownership of the Equity Groups.\n\nAdditionally, cash contributions that exceed an Equity Group's ownership equity percentage can also be made as a Subordinated Debt. This debt can include Warrant options and/or Payment-in-Kind (PIK) Interest, which allows the note holder to share in the success of the Company's future performance.\n\nWhen the Existing Company is combined with or purchases the Target Company, the resulting equity split becomes more complicated. The Existing Company's existing equity becomes part of the total Company equity, along with the equity contributions of the Equity Groups to purchase the Target Company. Each Equity Group's actual equity split of the Future Company (combined Target Company and Existing Company) is determined by the cash equity contributions and the Existing Company's net equity.\n\nIt is important to note that the resulting equity splits may not necessarily be the same as the Equity Percent Ownership inputs entered by the User in Step 8. The use of Equity Notes or Subordinated Debt by the non-Existing Company Equity Groups can be used to account for their contributions. The resulting equity splits will be listed in the message section on the bottom of the Step 8 input page.

It is calculated by subtracting the non-cash assets, such as Capitalized Goodwill (the amount paid for the company over the value of actual assets) and Capitalized Acquisition Costs and other Amortized Assets, from the Net Book Value of the company's Balance Sheet (Assets less Liabilities). This value is known as Hard Asset Liquidation or HA.\n\nThe purpose of Hard Asset Liquidation is to focus solely on the operating performance of the company and does not take into account the market value of the company beyond its tangible assets. It is important to note that the worst-case value may be even lower than the Net Book Value of the Hard Assets, so users should be aware of the relationship between Net Book Value without Goodwill and the actual realizable Market Value of the company when using this measure of value.\n\nIn the context of investment comparison, Hard Asset Liquidation is used as the Exit Value. However, to remove the influence of leverage on returns, the financing type of debt is ignored in the purchase, operation, and liquidation of the company. This adjusted value is referred to as Hard Asset/No Debt or HA/ND.\n\nFor the HA/ND IRR calculation in the investment comparison process, the HA/ND Liquidation value is used as the Exit Value. It does not incorporate any of the company's debt, and the annual cash return is calculated using EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization). In this case, any Accounts Payable listed as debt on the balance sheet are subtracted from the HA/ND value because EBITDA is calculated after subtracting all expenses except Interest, Income Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization expenses. Accounts Payable reflects expenses that are already subtracted to arrive at EBITDA, so they should be assumed paid for the purpose of calculating the cash return, thereby reducing the Exit Value assets."}]}

Goodwill represents the amount paid for the company over the value of its actual assets. By excluding Goodwill and debt from the valuation, HA/ND focuses solely on the tangible assets of the company.\n\nWhen calculating the Internal Rate of Return (IRR) using the HA/ND method, the HA/ND liquidation value is used as the exit value. This means that the value of the company's assets, excluding Goodwill and debt, is considered as the final value upon liquidation. Additionally, the annual cash return is measured using EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization).\n\nIt is important to note that when using EBITDA as the cash return, any Accounts Payable listed as debt on the balance sheet are subtracted from the HA/ND value. This is because EBITDA is calculated after subtracting all expenses except for Interest, Income Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization expenses.

This can include items such as old, spoiled, or obsolete inventory, aged accounts receivables, or any other factor that the lender believes may hinder the ability of the collateral to be converted into cash for loan repayment. Ineligibles are deducted from the asset value before applying the Loan to Value percentage to determine the loan amount. Lenders often use a predetermined percentage for Ineligibles, especially for certain types of inventory or accounts receivables that are over 60 days old and may be deemed uncollectable. Additionally, in the *ThruThink* analysis, there is an option to input an Ineligible amount or percentage for other senior debt categories besides accounts receivables and inventory, allowing users to account for potential differences in asset value with the lender or any other reason to reduce the asset value for lending purposes."}]}

Loan Reserves serve as a buffer to protect lenders from potential losses by setting aside funds to cover any potential decrease in collateral value. These reserves are typically used when collateral, such as inventory or accounts receivable, is deemed ineligible or of lower value due to factors like age, spoilage, obsolescence, or uncollectability. By reducing the collateral value by the Ineligible/Reserve percentage, lenders can determine the appropriate loan amount based on the remaining value of the collateral after accounting for potential risks. In the *ThruThink* analysis, Loan Reserves can be expressed as a percentage of the total loan collateral value, and the loan amount is calculated by reducing the collateral value by the Reserve percentage before applying the Loan to Value percentage."}]}

This implies that the financial arrangement may not be optimal for the owner.\n\n3. Capital expenditures: If the company requires significant capital expenditures, it can lower the Deal Score. This indicates that the owner may need to invest a substantial amount of money into the business, which can impact the overall deal.\n\n4. Owner draws: If the owner is taking excessive draws from the company, it can negatively impact the Deal Score. This suggests that the owner's actions may be detrimental to the financial health of the business.\n\nIt is important to note that the Deal Score is specifically focused on evaluating the comparative benefit to the owner based on user inputs, rather than assessing the overall quality of the company itself. Therefore, even an excellent company can receive a poor Deal Score if these factors are present."}]}
